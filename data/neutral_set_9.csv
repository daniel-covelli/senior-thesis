John Kennedy, R-L.A., questioned Judge Amy Coney Barrett on the second day of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing. Kennedy asked Barrett about the oath she would take upon confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court, which she said “boils down” to fairly applying the law as well as not giving preferential treatment or expressing bias.
“One of the things about the judicial role that I’ve repeatedly emphasized in the hearing today, is that I’ve got personal views and personal feelings on a range of matters, just like every human does, and just like every judge or justice on the court does,” Barrett said, but emphasized that she takes her oath to applying the law fairly, seriously.
Kennedy also questioned Barrett about her judicial philosophy, particularly as an originalist, or someone who believes that judges “must follow the original public meaning of the Constitution.” She clarified public meaning distinguishes from the “private intentions of those who drafted the document.""
The Oct. 13 hearing comes three weeks before Election Day. The second of four days of scheduled testimony gave senators an opportunity to ask Barrett about her record and approach to the law.

oCtdhatjeBI,Global News,UChLtXXpo4Ge1ReTEboVvTDg,1602658070.0,Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett questioned on 2nd day of hearings | HIGHLIGHTS,"U.S. Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett faced tough questions on issues including abortion, health care and the possibility of her having to rule on a case involving the 2020 presidential election during the second day of hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Barrett stressed she has not committed herself to anyone on how she would rule on an election dispute, saying she would commit to consider all factors about whether to recuse herself but she would not allow herself ""to be used as a pawn to decide this election for the American people.""

Asked about her opinion on abortion and the case of Roe v. Wade, she sidestepped questions about whether she agreed with former Justice Antonin Scalia that the case was ""wrongly decided,"" saying she is not going into the court with an ""agenda"" to overturn the case. She also added when asked about the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, that she was ""not on a mission to destroy"" it. 

Democrats have been concerned based on comments by President Donald Trump that Coney Barrett could possibly join other conservative justices on the court and overturn the health care legislation.

YJocL_RaR-c,PBS NewsHour,UC6ZFN9Tx6xh-skXCuRHCDpQ,1602737591.0,Sen. Kamala Harris questions Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett on voter suppression,"Senator Kamala Harris, D-Calif., questioned Judge Amy Coney Barrett on Oct. 14, the third day of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing. Harris referenced the 1965 Voting Rights Act and its role in fighting voter suppression. But she pointed to the ramifications of later rulings like the Supreme Court’s 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder, which essentially eliminated a requirement that forced jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to seek federal approval for changes in voting laws. Harris pointed to 23 states that have passed laws that restricted voting in the wake of that decision, adding that those states have also attempted to limit early voting and close polling locations, which disproportionately affects communities of color.
“Any nominee to the Supreme Court must understand the effect of ongoing efforts to discriminate against Black Americans, Latino Americans, Native Americans, students and other communities of color,” Harris said. She asked if Barrett agreed with Chief Justice John Roberts’ comment on the Shelby County decision that “voting discrimination still exists, no one doubts that.” 
After commenting on some of the details of that decision, Barrett s declined to comment ""on what any Justice said, an opinion — whether an opinion is right or wrong — or endorse that proposition.” When pressed, Barrett added: “I'm not going to say that I endorse either the majority or the dissent in the case of Shelby County.""

Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, questioned Judge Amy Coney Barrett on Oct. 14, the third day of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing. Hirono asked about Barrett’s writings on several cases, ultimately wondering whether her previous work on Bush v. Gore would be a conflict of interest if a case about the results of the 2020 presidential election were to come before the court. “Do you think that having three justices who have worked on the Republican side on Bush v. Gore -- you’re one of those justices, should you be confirmed -- creates an appearance of conflict if an election case involving a president who nominated you comes before the court?” Hirono said. “I answered that question before and said any question of whether there was an appearance of partiality problem would be one for all justices involved to consider under the recusal statute,” Barrett said. “My question was whether it poses an appearance of conflict, and I believe the fact that you would even bring forth the recusal process says to me that voters might decide there is an appearance of conflict,” Hirono said.

Blumenthal asked Barrett about a letter featured in a newspaper she signed in 2006 that opposed abortion and called for “the right to life from fertilization to natural death.” ""I didn't have any recollection of that letter. I signed it almost 15 years ago quickly on my way out of church,"" Barrett said when asked whether she disclosed the existence of the letter during her nomination process to the 7th Circuit court. Barrett said she signed on to the letter based on personal religious beliefs, but it would not be appropriate to express a personal opinion about the landmark Roe v. Wade decision as a judge. The Oct. 13 hearing comes three weeks before Election Day. The second of four days of scheduled testimony gave senators an opportunity to ask Barrett about her record and approach to the law.

wH8J477_L28,CNBC Television,UCrp_UI8XtuYfpiqluWLD7Lw,1602911673.0,Watch the top moments from Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court confirmation hearings,"The Senate confirmation hearings for Judge Amy Coney Barrett concluded Thursday. Here are some of Judge Barrett's most attention grabbing answers from the proceedings. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi 

The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday scheduled an Oct. 22 vote on whether to approve Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court in a rowdy hearing in which Democrats made procedural objections and said the rush to confirm the nominee was unprecedented.

As the hearing unfolded in Washington, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly said in Kentucky that the Senate had the votes to confirm Barrett to the high court, essentially assuring that the efforts by Democrats to delay her confirmation will be unsuccessful.

McConnell, who was in his home state to cast his ballot, said he expects to bring Barrett’s nomination to the Senate floor on Oct. 23, Bloomberg News reported. That time frame would allow her to be seated ahead of the Nov. 3 election between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee.

There was little doubt that Republicans, who hold 53 seats in the Senate, would have the necessary votes, though Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine have objected. Trump has repeatedly pressed for Barrett to be seated in time to resolve any election disputes that arise.

The developments came after Barrett faced two days of intense but civil marathon questioning by senators on the Judiciary Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday. Barrett is expected to be confirmed by the committee by a party line vote, with all 12 Republicans in her favor and 10 Democrats opposed.

Democratic senators tried in vain to derail Thursday’s committee hearing. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., objected to the GOP effort to schedule the vote by noting that he was the only Democrat in the room, and that the rules required at least two members of the minority party to be present.

Committee Chairman Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., pushed on anyway.

“If we create this problem for you in the future, you are going to do what I am going to do, which is move forward with the business of the committee,” Graham told him.

Some Democrats, who had been waiting outside the hearing room, entered and objected to Graham’s move.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said the process was a “rush” and a “sham” and motioned to adjourn the hearing, prompting a round of speeches by members of the committee.

Chris Coons, D-Del., asked Judge Amy Coney Barrett whether she would recuse herself from a vote that might settle the presidential election results should President Donald Trump dispute the outcome of his race against former Vice President Joe Biden.

“I think the core issue in recusal is that any judge or justice should recuse themselves from a case in which their impartiality might reasonably be questioned,” Coons said, before asking Barrett if she would recuse herself.

“No matter what anyone else may think or expect, I have not committed to anyone...I certainly hope that all members of the committee have more confidence in my integrity than to think that I would allow myself to be used as a pawn to decide this election for the American people.”

Barrett faced questions from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the second of four days of scheduled testimony as part of the committee’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings. The Oct. 13 hearing gave senators an opportunity to ask Barrett about her record and approach to the law.

Chris Coons, D-Del., about a 2017 law review article she wrote critiquing an opinion from Chief Justice John Roberts that upheld the tenets of the Affordable Care Act. Barrett said that she was not chastising Roberts for his interpretation, adding that she is “not hostile” to the health care legislation and would evaluate future cases concerning the law without bias. “I’m not here on a mission to destroy the Affordable Care Act. I’m just here to apply the law and adhere to the rule of law,” Barrett said.
Barrett faced questions from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the second of four days of scheduled testimony as part of the committee’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings. The Oct. 13 hearing gave senators an opportunity to ask Barrett about her record and approach to the law.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, questioned Judge Amy Coney Barrett on Oct. 14, the third day of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing. During his line of questioning, he criticized Democrats’ “assault on the Federalist Society” and its efforts to appoint conservative judges like Barrett to the federal bench. Cruz also said policy disputes over issues such as health care and school choice are best handled by the legislature, rather than the judiciary. “It’s not a judge’s role” to mandate policies favored by either Republicans or Democrats, he argued. Lastly, he expressed concern over the idea of “packing the court” with more justices, a move that is favored by some progressives but has not been endorsed by top Democrats or the party’s presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden. The hearing came about three weeks before Election Day. The third of four days of scheduled testimony gave senators another opportunity to ask Barrett about her record and approach to the law.

wH8J477_L28,CNBC Television,UCrp_UI8XtuYfpiqluWLD7Lw,1602911673.0,Watch the top moments from Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court confirmation hearings,"The Senate confirmation hearings for Judge Amy Coney Barrett concluded Thursday. Here are some of Judge Barrett's most attention grabbing answers from the proceedings. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi 

The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday scheduled an Oct. 22 vote on whether to approve Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court in a rowdy hearing in which Democrats made procedural objections and said the rush to confirm the nominee was unprecedented.

As the hearing unfolded in Washington, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly said in Kentucky that the Senate had the votes to confirm Barrett to the high court, essentially assuring that the efforts by Democrats to delay her confirmation will be unsuccessful.

McConnell, who was in his home state to cast his ballot, said he expects to bring Barrett’s nomination to the Senate floor on Oct. 23, Bloomberg News reported. That time frame would allow her to be seated ahead of the Nov. 3 election between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee.

There was little doubt that Republicans, who hold 53 seats in the Senate, would have the necessary votes, though Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine have objected. Trump has repeatedly pressed for Barrett to be seated in time to resolve any election disputes that arise.

The developments came after Barrett faced two days of intense but civil marathon questioning by senators on the Judiciary Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday. Barrett is expected to be confirmed by the committee by a party line vote, with all 12 Republicans in her favor and 10 Democrats opposed.

Democratic senators tried in vain to derail Thursday’s committee hearing. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., objected to the GOP effort to schedule the vote by noting that he was the only Democrat in the room, and that the rules required at least two members of the minority party to be present.

Committee Chairman Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., pushed on anyway.

“If we create this problem for you in the future, you are going to do what I am going to do, which is move forward with the business of the committee,” Graham told him.

Some Democrats, who had been waiting outside the hearing room, entered and objected to Graham’s move.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said the process was a “rush” and a “sham” and motioned to adjourn the hearing, prompting a round of speeches by members of the committee.

Chris Coons, D-Del., asked Judge Amy Coney Barrett whether she would recuse herself from a vote that might settle the presidential election results should President Donald Trump dispute the outcome of his race against former Vice President Joe Biden.

“I think the core issue in recusal is that any judge or justice should recuse themselves from a case in which their impartiality might reasonably be questioned,” Coons said, before asking Barrett if she would recuse herself.

“No matter what anyone else may think or expect, I have not committed to anyone...I certainly hope that all members of the committee have more confidence in my integrity than to think that I would allow myself to be used as a pawn to decide this election for the American people.”

Barrett faced questions from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the second of four days of scheduled testimony as part of the committee’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings. The Oct. 13 hearing gave senators an opportunity to ask Barrett about her record and approach to the law.

Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., moved to ""indefinitely postpone the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett"" to the Supreme Court on Oct. 15 during the last day of confirmation proceedings held by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
""I believe that this rushed, sham process is a disservice to our committee. She has been rushed in a way that is historically unprecedented,"" Blumenthal said.
Blumenthal's motion failed after committee members voted along party lines, 10-12. Chair Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said the committee would vote Oct. 22 on Barrett's nomination.

If the 2020 US presidential election is close, the race could drag on in the courts and halls of Congress long after ballots are cast, says lawyer and political commentator Van Jones. Explaining why the customary concession speech is one of the most important safeguards for democracy, Jones exposes shocking legal loopholes that could enable a candidate to grab power even if they lose both the popular vote and the electoral college -- and shares what ordinary citizens can do if there's no peaceful transfer of power.

But today, more than 10 years after the completion of these islands, there is hardly anything built on them. What happened here?

Oj9GpZB9cuc,USA TODAY,UCP6HGa63sBC7-KHtkme-p-g,1604507075.0,"Presidential Election Results: LIVE coverage of Trump, Biden and key races | USA TODAY","Live results from the 2020 presidential election as Americans vote in races for the presidency, 11 governorships, 35 Senate seats and all 435 House seats. Results map refreshes every 60 seconds.

Final polls show the race between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden has tightened since mid-October, both nationally and in battleground states.

Biden's lead in USA TODAY's average of averages, which is based on data from RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight, reached double-digits on Oct. 12, but has since fallen back to a 7.5-percentage point lead. That leaves him back roughly in the same position USA TODAY found him in its first poll roundup on Sept. 28, when his polling average lead over Trump was 7.2 points. 

Beyond the presidency, Tuesday's election may result in changes in Congress, where Democrats want to regain control of the Republican-led Senate and Democrats hope to expand their advantage in the House.

Republicans have broken politics.,"Neither party is perfect, but Republicans in Congress have been drifting towards political extremism since long before Trump, and they’re making it impossible for Congress to work the way it’s supposed to.

Over the past few decades, both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have moved away from the center. But the Republican Party has moved towards the extreme much more quickly -- a trend that political scientists’ call “asymmetrical polarization.”

That asymmetry poses a major obstacle in American politics. As Republicans have become more ideological, they’ve also become less willing to work with Democrats: filibustering Democratic legislation, refusing to consider Democratic appointees, and even shutting down the government in order to force Democrats to give in to their demands. 

Democrats have responded in turn, becoming more obstructionist as Republican demands become more extreme. 

And that’s made it really easy for media outlets to blame “both sides” for political gridlock. As political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein explain in their book “It’s Even Worse Than It Looks,” journalists feel a pressure to remain neutral when covering big political fights. So politics coverage has been dominated by the myth that both parties are equally to blame for the gridlock in DC. 

But they’re not. And the only way to stop Republicans in Congress from continuing their drift towards the extreme is to be brutally honest about who’s responsible for breaking our politics.

Putin's Kleptocracy: Who Owns Russia? By Karen Dawisha

Vladimir Putin has been ruling Russia since 1999. In that time he has shaped the country into an authoritarian and militaristic society. The Soviet Union dissolved into 15 new countries, including the new Russian Federation. In Putin’s eyes, Russia had just lost 2 million square miles of territory. But Putin’s regime has also developed and fostered the most effect cyber hacker army in the world and he’s used it to wreak havoc in the West. But the election of Donald Trump brings new hope for the Putin vision. Trump’s rhetoric has been notably soft on Russia. He could lift sanctions and weaken NATO, potentially freeing up space for Putin’s Russia to become a dominant power once again.

Correction at 7:23: Cynthia's ancestors lived in Wilmington, not her descendants.

In November 1898, in Wilmington, North Carolina, a mob of 2,000 white men expelled black and white political leaders, destroyed the property of the city’s black residents, and killed dozens--if not hundreds--of people. How did such a turn of events change the course of the city? For decades, the story of this violence was buried, while the perpetrators were cast as heroes. Yet its impacts resonate across the state to this day.

In the new Vox series Missing Chapter, Vox Senior Producer Ranjani Chakraborty revisits underreported and often overlooked moments from the past to give context to the present. Join her as she covers the histories that are often left out of our textbooks. Our first season tackles stories of racial injustice, political conflicts, even the hidden history of US medical experimentation.

Watch more of our election coverage: http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

In the 2000 US presidential election, the Democratic candidate got half a million more votes than the Republican. The Democrat lost. Sixteen years later the same thing happened again. In the US, if you run for president, it does not actually matter how many people in the country vote for you. What matters instead is an arcane system for selecting America’s head of state called the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is the reason the US has something called “swing states,” and it’s the reason those places get to decide the future of the country. It’s the reason presidential candidates almost never campaign in the country’s biggest cities. And more recently, it’s also the reason that Republican candidates have been able to eke out victories in the presidential election without actually getting the most votes.

The Electoral College makes some Americans’ votes more powerful than others. In fact, that’s part of the reason we have it to begin with; in the country’s early years, the Electoral College helped give the votes of Southern Whites more weight than the votes of Northerners. The idea at its core, that certain votes simply matter more than others, is baked into the American tradition. In the 2020 election, it may decide the winner.

This video was produced in collaboration between Vox and BBCThree.

Over the course of her 63-year reign, Queen Victoria strategically planned marriages to place her descendants in royal families all over Europe. In doing so, she created one of the most remarkable royal families in history. 

By the early 19th century, Europe had been at war for decades. After the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars killed millions, European leaders came together to restore peace by reshaping major states for a new balance of power. Great Britain went on to become one of the strongest states. And years later, Queen Victoria and her husband Albert came up with a plan to maintain that political power — they married their children to monarchs across Europe. By the 1880s Queen Victoria’s children were in several important branches of Europe’s monarchies. 

The royal unions didn't play out as Queen Victoria planned, but she continued to make more matches anyway. She had 42 grandchildren, and these 7 ended up on royal thrones. Her grandchildren would end up on the thrones of Britain, Russia, Germany, Romania, Norway, and Spain leading up to the most destructive war Europe had ever seen.  

To truly understand the international conflicts and trends shaping our world you need a big-picture view. Video journalist Sam Ellis uses maps to tell these stories and chart their effects on foreign policy.

After eight years of attacking President Obama, Fox has happily adapted to its new role as a guard dog for the Trump administration. But the relationship between Fox and Trump is less of a romance and more of a hostage situation. Rupert Murdoch, Executive Chairman of News Corp (which owns Fox News), was a vocal critic of Trump during the 2016 campaign. He criticized Trump’s position on immigration, accused Trump of “embarrassing” the country, and was once described as “the billionaire Donald Trump can’t win over.”
So what explains Murdoch’s change of heart? Why is one of Trump’s most influential critics allowing his network to turn into a Trump PR channel?

After prohibition — the total ban on alcohol — many states established a minimum legal drinking age of 21. But that began to change after the voting age was lowered to 18. Many states followed by lowering their drinking ages, which changed the landscape for the entire country.

By the 1980s, this unusual patchwork of drinking ages started to be seen as a problem, especially by activist organizations like MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Drivers) and RID (Remove Intoxicated Drivers). They lobbied for a 21-year-old minimum legal drinking age, and President Ronald Reagan supported the cause. His mechanism for enabling a national law? Threatening to withhold Federal Highway funding to states that didn’t comply.

It was an unpredictable strategy for an official typically hesitant to use federal power over the states, and the practice was eventually challenged in the Supreme Court, where it was upheld.

Beyond the political clash, it’s a look at how roads shape policy.

Fox News constantly accuses other news organizations of having a liberal bias, claiming networks like CNN and MSNBC are in bed with the Democratic Party. But over the past few years, major Fox personalities ike Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, and Jeanine Pirro have become more open about their support for the Republican Party -- appearing at GOP campaign events, speaking at Republican fundraisers, and even explicitly endorsing Republican candidates on air. Republican candidates have noticed, and have begun using friendly coverage on Fox as part of their campaign strategies. 

Fox News is transforming from a right-wing news network into a full-on Republican campaign operation. Pretty soon, people like Sean Hannity won’t have to leave their studio sets to be on the campaign trail.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

The US Senate is supposed to pass laws. But today, it’s broken. And it’s broken because of something called the filibuster, which has been part of Senate tradition for over 200 years. But the filibuster came into being by accident. And today, some politicians are suggesting we should get rid of it entirely.

You might have heard that the poor in America barely pay any taxes. And if you look at a chart of how much every American pays in income taxes, that seems basically true. But income taxes are just one type of the many taxes we pay. So what happens if we add them all up? A new analysis by the economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman did exactly that. And it shows that the American tax system might not be as ""progressive"" as many people believe.

Read more about that analysis in an op-ed Saez and Zucman wrote for the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/opinion/sunday/wealth-income-tax-rate.html

All of their data, which we used to produce this video, is available on their website: https://taxjusticenow.org/

Their full research is presented in their book, the Triumph of Injustice: https://www.amazon.com/Triumph-Injustice-Rich-Dodge-Taxes/dp/1324002727

Become a member of the Vox Video Lab! http://bit.ly/video-lab

Tucker Carlson has branded himself as a populist, condemning the “liberal elite” that he argues makes up the American “ruling class.” It’s a good shtick, and it’s helped him stand out from other Fox News hosts. But while Tucker decries the “elite” on his show, he regularly ignores major stories of Republican economic policies that harm the working class, choosing instead to focus on bogus culture war stories.

That isn’t an accident. Carlson’s show is meant to distract Fox News viewers from Republican economics, channeling their frustration and anger at groups that don’t deserve it. That kind of misdirection produces what Marxist theorists call “false consciousness”: when workers are tricked into accepting their own exploitation.

“Don’t normalize this” has become a kind of rallying cry during President Trump’s first year in office -- a reminder to not get too acclimated to Trump’s norm-breaking and erratic behavior. 
But the real danger of the Trump presidency might have less to do with Trump’s abnormality and more to do with how “normal” he makes other Republicans look by comparison.

Republicans have broken politics.,"Neither party is perfect, but Republicans in Congress have been drifting towards political extremism since long before Trump, and they’re making it impossible for Congress to work the way it’s supposed to.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Over the past few decades, both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have moved away from the center. But the Republican Party has moved towards the extreme much more quickly -- a trend that political scientists’ call “asymmetrical polarization.”

That asymmetry poses a major obstacle in American politics. As Republicans have become more ideological, they’ve also become less willing to work with Democrats: filibustering Democratic legislation, refusing to consider Democratic appointees, and even shutting down the government in order to force Democrats to give in to their demands. 

Democrats have responded in turn, becoming more obstructionist as Republican demands become more extreme. 

And that’s made it really easy for media outlets to blame “both sides” for political gridlock. As political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein explain in their book “It’s Even Worse Than It Looks,” journalists feel a pressure to remain neutral when covering big political fights. So politics coverage has been dominated by the myth that both parties are equally to blame for the gridlock in DC. 

But they’re not. And the only way to stop Republicans in Congress from continuing their drift towards the extreme is to be brutally honest about who’s responsible for breaking our politics.

Vladimir Putin has been ruling Russia since 1999. In that time he has shaped the country into an authoritarian and militaristic society. The Soviet Union dissolved into 15 new countries, including the new Russian Federation. In Putin’s eyes, Russia had just lost 2 million square miles of territory. But Putin’s regime has also developed and fostered the most effect cyber hacker army in the world and he’s used it to wreak havoc in the West. But the election of Donald Trump brings new hope for the Putin vision. Trump’s rhetoric has been notably soft on Russia. He could lift sanctions and weaken NATO, potentially freeing up space for Putin’s Russia to become a dominant power once again.

Correction at 7:23: Cynthia's ancestors lived in Wilmington, not her descendants.

In November 1898, in Wilmington, North Carolina, a mob of 2,000 white men expelled black and white political leaders, destroyed the property of the city’s black residents, and killed dozens--if not hundreds--of people. How did such a turn of events change the course of the city? For decades, the story of this violence was buried, while the perpetrators were cast as heroes. Yet its impacts resonate across the state to this day.

In the new Vox series Missing Chapter, Vox Senior Producer Ranjani Chakraborty revisits underreported and often overlooked moments from the past to give context to the present. Join her as she covers the histories that are often left out of our textbooks. Our first season tackles stories of racial injustice, political conflicts, even the hidden history of US medical experimentation.

Watch more of our election coverage: http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

In the 2000 US presidential election, the Democratic candidate got half a million more votes than the Republican. The Democrat lost. Sixteen years later the same thing happened again. In the US, if you run for president, it does not actually matter how many people in the country vote for you. What matters instead is an arcane system for selecting America’s head of state called the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is the reason the US has something called “swing states,” and it’s the reason those places get to decide the future of the country. It’s the reason presidential candidates almost never campaign in the country’s biggest cities. And more recently, it’s also the reason that Republican candidates have been able to eke out victories in the presidential election without actually getting the most votes.

The Electoral College makes some Americans’ votes more powerful than others. In fact, that’s part of the reason we have it to begin with; in the country’s early years, the Electoral College helped give the votes of Southern Whites more weight than the votes of Northerners. The idea at its core, that certain votes simply matter more than others, is baked into the American tradition. In the 2020 election, it may decide the winner.

This video was produced in collaboration between Vox and BBCThree.

Over the course of her 63-year reign, Queen Victoria strategically planned marriages to place her descendants in royal families all over Europe. In doing so, she created one of the most remarkable royal families in history. 

By the early 19th century, Europe had been at war for decades. After the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars killed millions, European leaders came together to restore peace by reshaping major states for a new balance of power. Great Britain went on to become one of the strongest states. And years later, Queen Victoria and her husband Albert came up with a plan to maintain that political power — they married their children to monarchs across Europe. By the 1880s Queen Victoria’s children were in several important branches of Europe’s monarchies. 

The royal unions didn't play out as Queen Victoria planned, but she continued to make more matches anyway. She had 42 grandchildren, and these 7 ended up on royal thrones. Her grandchildren would end up on the thrones of Britain, Russia, Germany, Romania, Norway, and Spain leading up to the most destructive war Europe had ever seen.

Follow Strikethrough on Facebook! https://www.facebook.com/CarlosMazaVox/

After eight years of attacking President Obama, Fox has happily adapted to its new role as a guard dog for the Trump administration. But the relationship between Fox and Trump is less of a romance and more of a hostage situation. Rupert Murdoch, Executive Chairman of News Corp (which owns Fox News), was a vocal critic of Trump during the 2016 campaign. He criticized Trump’s position on immigration, accused Trump of “embarrassing” the country, and was once described as “the billionaire Donald Trump can’t win over.”
So what explains Murdoch’s change of heart? Why is one of Trump’s most influential critics allowing his network to turn into a Trump PR channel?

After prohibition — the total ban on alcohol — many states established a minimum legal drinking age of 21. But that began to change after the voting age was lowered to 18. Many states followed by lowering their drinking ages, which changed the landscape for the entire country.

By the 1980s, this unusual patchwork of drinking ages started to be seen as a problem, especially by activist organizations like MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Drivers) and RID (Remove Intoxicated Drivers). They lobbied for a 21-year-old minimum legal drinking age, and President Ronald Reagan supported the cause. His mechanism for enabling a national law? Threatening to withhold Federal Highway funding to states that didn’t comply.

It was an unpredictable strategy for an official typically hesitant to use federal power over the states, and the practice was eventually challenged in the Supreme Court, where it was upheld.

Beyond the political clash, it’s a look at how roads shape policy.

Today’s Republican Party opposes big government. It’s culturally conservative. Its demographic support is strongest among white voters, and it usually dominates elections in the South. And its 2016 presidential nominee has been heavily criticized for inciting racial tensions.

But things weren’t always this way. 

Over the past 160 or so years, the party has undergone a remarkable transformation from the party of Abraham Lincoln… to the party of Donald Trump.

Watch more of our election coverage: http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

In the 2000 US presidential election, the Democratic candidate got half a million more votes than the Republican. The Democrat lost. Sixteen years later the same thing happened again. In the US, if you run for president, it does not actually matter how many people in the country vote for you. What matters instead is an arcane system for selecting America’s head of state called the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is the reason the US has something called “swing states,” and it’s the reason those places get to decide the future of the country. It’s the reason presidential candidates almost never campaign in the country’s biggest cities. And more recently, it’s also the reason that Republican candidates have been able to eke out victories in the presidential election without actually getting the most votes.

The Electoral College makes some Americans’ votes more powerful than others. In fact, that’s part of the reason we have it to begin with; in the country’s early years, the Electoral College helped give the votes of Southern Whites more weight than the votes of Northerners. The idea at its core, that certain votes simply matter more than others, is baked into the American tradition. In the 2020 election, it may decide the winner.

Fox News constantly accuses other news organizations of having a liberal bias, claiming networks like CNN and MSNBC are in bed with the Democratic Party. But over the past few years, major Fox personalities ike Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, and Jeanine Pirro have become more open about their support for the Republican Party -- appearing at GOP campaign events, speaking at Republican fundraisers, and even explicitly endorsing Republican candidates on air. Republican candidates have noticed, and have begun using friendly coverage on Fox as part of their campaign strategies. 

Fox News is transforming from a right-wing news network into a full-on Republican campaign operation. Pretty soon, people like Sean Hannity won’t have to leave their studio sets to be on the campaign trail.

You might have heard that the poor in America barely pay any taxes. And if you look at a chart of how much every American pays in income taxes, that seems basically true. But income taxes are just one type of the many taxes we pay. So what happens if we add them all up? A new analysis by the economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman did exactly that. And it shows that the American tax system might not be as ""progressive"" as many people believe.

Tucker Carlson has branded himself as a populist, condemning the “liberal elite” that he argues makes up the American “ruling class.” It’s a good shtick, and it’s helped him stand out from other Fox News hosts. But while Tucker decries the “elite” on his show, he regularly ignores major stories of Republican economic policies that harm the working class, choosing instead to focus on bogus culture war stories.

That isn’t an accident. Carlson’s show is meant to distract Fox News viewers from Republican economics, channeling their frustration and anger at groups that don’t deserve it. That kind of misdirection produces what Marxist theorists call “false consciousness”: when workers are tricked into accepting their own exploitation.

But the real danger of the Trump presidency might have less to do with Trump’s abnormality and more to do with how “normal” he makes other Republicans look by comparison.

Addressing supporters, Biden said he believes he is ""on track"" to win. He flipped Arizona, while taking California, Washington, New York and Illinois.
Trump claimed victory prematurely and has continued to falsely claim ballots counted after election day signal malfeasance. He takes Florida, Ohio, Iowa, Missouri and Texas.

As things stand, we still don't know who the next president is. Both candidates are claiming to be on track for victory, but everything depends on a handful of key states which have yet to declare. 

Mr Trump - making baseless claims of “major fraud” - called for the vote counting to stop. Mr Biden's team called that “outrageous”.

But the election result may not be clear for days. What we can say, though, is that Mr Trump appears to be doing far better than the polls predicted, and turnout has been unprecedented.

Claire McCaskill says “the polling was clearly off, badly” because Democrats did much worse than expected. Rich Lowry, editor of the conservative National Review, says that a “silent plurality” of Trump supporters that was missed by the polls and the pundits and that Joe Biden was “too passive.” He also calls Trump’s claim of victory in the election “irresponsible.”

Watch more of our election coverage: http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

In the 2000 US presidential election, the Democratic candidate got half a million more votes than the Republican. The Democrat lost. Sixteen years later the same thing happened again. In the US, if you run for president, it does not actually matter how many people in the country vote for you. What matters instead is an arcane system for selecting America’s head of state called the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is the reason the US has something called “swing states,” and it’s the reason those places get to decide the future of the country. It’s the reason presidential candidates almost never campaign in the country’s biggest cities. And more recently, it’s also the reason that Republican candidates have been able to eke out victories in the presidential election without actually getting the most votes.

The Electoral College makes some Americans’ votes more powerful than others. In fact, that’s part of the reason we have it to begin with; in the country’s early years, the Electoral College helped give the votes of Southern Whites more weight than the votes of Northerners. The idea at its core, that certain votes simply matter more than others, is baked into the American tradition. In the 2020 election, it may decide the winner.

Further reading:
The historian Alexander Keyssar’s book “Why Do We Still Have the Electoral College?” takes you through the history and function of the Electoral College: https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674660151

For the bite-sized version of that history, Keyssar also wrote this piece in the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/opinion/electoral-college-racism-white-supremacy.html

The Times also had a great interactive feature on where the 2020 candidates actually spent money: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/17/us/politics/trump-biden-campaign-ad-spending.html

Pew has a breakdown of how democracies around the world elect their head of state, which really shows what an oddball the US is: https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/22/among-democracies-u-s-stands-out-in-how-it-chooses-its-head-of-state/
