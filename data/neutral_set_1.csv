12,_zhWHsfEa0U,Sky News Australia,UCO0akufu9MOzyz3nvGIXAAw,1603033305.0,EXCLUSIVE: Joe Biden's son emailed shop owner about hard drive to 'get it back': Former Trump chief,"Steve Bannon, former chief strategist to President Donald Trump, has revealed Joe Biden's son emailed a shop owner who had his hard drive in an effort to get it back.

The revelations come as the New York Post this week released an expose detailing links between Joe Biden and his son who was paid at least $50,000 a month to sit on the board of a Ukrainian energy company who allegedly set up a meeting with the then-Vice President.

Information regarding Hunter Biden’s relationship with the Ukranian energy company was sourced from a collection of emails recovered from a laptop that was allegedly dropped off at a repair shop in 2019 and later given to the FBI.

It was a water-damaged MacBook Pro and the person who dropped it off never paid for the service and didn't retrieve it or a hard drive on which its contents were stored - according to the shop owner who said he repeatedly tried to contact the customer.
 
Sky News host Sharri Markson said the owner of the repair shop in Biden's home state of Delaware says when he did not hear back from the FBI, he made a copy of the hard drive and gave it to Donald Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
 

Emails on the laptop revealed that Hunter Biden had planned to introduce his father – the then-Vice President – to an executive at Ukrainian energy company Burisma, a company where Hunter served on the board of directors.

Publicly, Biden has said he's never spoken to his son about his overseas business dealings. These emails seem to indicate otherwise.
 
In one message sent by Vadym Pozharsky in April 2015, he wrote: ""Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent (sic) some time together. It's realty (sic) an honour and pleasure.""

In response to this news, Facebook and Twitter both censored the article from the New York Post, advising they were ""limiting the distribution"" of the story on their platforms until a third-party contractor can ""fact check"" the article.

Mr Bannon told Ms Markson, “Hunter Biden’s lawyer has come to us both with phone calls and with emails saying, ‘hey, I’ve got to get the hard drive back’.”

“This is not some Russian intelligence operation; they admit it’s their hard drive,” Mr Bannon said.

“We have the emails from the Lawyer, if we need to release them, we’ll release them.”",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_zhWHsfEa0U/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-22 11:47:54.842793,1.3333333333333333,"['PartisanRight', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanRight']",Right,False,1,CI_WpkNn454

Biden swiped at Trump over the president’s early handling of the coronavirus, alleging that the administration started to inform the public of the disease’s severity only when it hit the stock market.

“Do you believe for a moment what he’s telling you in light of all the lies he’s told you about the whole issue relating to Covid?” Biden asked. “He still hasn’t even acknowledged that he knew this was happening — knew how dangerous it would be back in February — and he didn’t even tell you.”

“He panicked, or just looked at the stock market, one of the two,” Biden added. “Because guess what? A lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter or a lot quicker.”

Chappelle also advocated that black people legally buy guns as a sort of protest troll—if for nothing else—to have white legislators alter the Second Amendment out of fear.

Are Trump allies peddling Russian disinformation about the Bidens?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQX-XSCMMdY

Why talking to Ukrainian officials disproves the Trump narrative on Biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUSU_JDClE
--------
Pam Bondi, the former attorney general of Florida who is a member of the Trump impeachment legal team, outlined on Jan. 27 the concerns she said the president had about potential corruption on the part of the Bidens in Ukraine. Bondi pointed to numerous news reports raising questions about Hunter Biden’s appointment to the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma. The move “looks nepotistic at best, nefarious at worst,” Bondi said, speaking on the Senate floor during the impeachment trial. 

While some ethics experts have said Hunter Biden’s seat on the Burisma board could raise the appearance of a conflict of interest, independent news reports have found no wrongdoing by Hunter Biden or former vice president Joe Biden. 

Democrats argue Trump used the idea of corruption as a cover for efforts to get Ukraine to investigate his political rival. Trump’s defense team is presenting their arguments as part of the Senate impeachment trial. The trial has entered a pivotal week as his defense team resumes its case and senators face a critical vote on whether to hear witnesses or proceed directly to a vote that is widely expected to end in his acquittal. The articles of impeachment charge Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The House of Representatives impeached the president in December on those two counts.

Herschmann cast doubt on Hunter’s previous statements that he joined the board of Burisma to enforce corporate governance and transparency in Ukraine and criticized Democrats for dismissing the issue: “Can you imagine what House manager Schiff would say if it was one of the President Trump’s children who was on an oligarch’s payroll?” he asked.

58,_zhWHsfEa0U,Sky News Australia,UCO0akufu9MOzyz3nvGIXAAw,1603033305.0,EXCLUSIVE: Joe Biden's son emailed shop owner about hard drive to 'get it back': Former Trump chief,"Steve Bannon, former chief strategist to President Donald Trump, has revealed Joe Biden's son emailed a shop owner who had his hard drive in an effort to get it back.

The revelations come as the New York Post this week released an expose detailing links between Joe Biden and his son who was paid at least $50,000 a month to sit on the board of a Ukrainian energy company who allegedly set up a meeting with the then-Vice President.

Information regarding Hunter Biden’s relationship with the Ukranian energy company was sourced from a collection of emails recovered from a laptop that was allegedly dropped off at a repair shop in 2019 and later given to the FBI.

It was a water-damaged MacBook Pro and the person who dropped it off never paid for the service and didn't retrieve it or a hard drive on which its contents were stored - according to the shop owner who said he repeatedly tried to contact the customer.
 
Sky News host Sharri Markson said the owner of the repair shop in Biden's home state of Delaware says when he did not hear back from the FBI, he made a copy of the hard drive and gave it to Donald Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
 

Emails on the laptop revealed that Hunter Biden had planned to introduce his father – the then-Vice President – to an executive at Ukrainian energy company Burisma, a company where Hunter served on the board of directors.

Publicly, Biden has said he's never spoken to his son about his overseas business dealings. These emails seem to indicate otherwise.
 
In one message sent by Vadym Pozharsky in April 2015, he wrote: ""Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent (sic) some time together. It's realty (sic) an honour and pleasure.""

In response to this news, Facebook and Twitter both censored the article from the New York Post, advising they were ""limiting the distribution"" of the story on their platforms until a third-party contractor can ""fact check"" the article.

Mr Bannon told Ms Markson, “Hunter Biden’s lawyer has come to us both with phone calls and with emails saying, ‘hey, I’ve got to get the hard drive back’.”

“This is not some Russian intelligence operation; they admit it’s their hard drive,” Mr Bannon said.

“We have the emails from the Lawyer, if we need to release them, we’ll release them.”",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_zhWHsfEa0U/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-22 11:48:08.284440,1.3333333333333333,"['PartisanRight', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanRight']",Right,True,3,oPvMuzyVOig

The event is Obama's first stump speech for his former vice president, a welcome sight to Democrats who see the former president as Joe Biden's most potent character witness and a key factor in encouraging Black men, Latinos and younger voters to turn out and vote.
Obama's speech represented his most direct attacks on Trump to date, with the former Democratic leader leveling both substantive critiques -- like questioning Trump's tax policy and handling of the coronavirus pandemic -- and personal barbs, jabbing at shrinking ratings for the President's speeches and town halls.
The remarks drilled down on years of Democratic concerns about the President, with Obama arguing Trump's presidency has not only changed the way other countries view the United States but remade the way Americans feel about politics.

The event is Obama's first stump speech for his former vice president, a welcome sight to Democrats who see the former president as Joe Biden's most potent character witness and a key factor in encouraging Black men, Latinos and younger voters to turn out and vote.
Obama's speech represented his most direct attacks on Trump to date, with the former Democratic leader leveling both substantive critiques -- like questioning Trump's tax policy and handling of the coronavirus pandemic -- and personal barbs, jabbing at shrinking ratings for the President's speeches and town halls.
The remarks drilled down on years of Democratic concerns about the President, with Obama arguing Trump's presidency has not only changed the way other countries view the United States but remade the way Americans feel about politics.

119,_zhWHsfEa0U,Sky News Australia,UCO0akufu9MOzyz3nvGIXAAw,1603033305.0,EXCLUSIVE: Joe Biden's son emailed shop owner about hard drive to 'get it back': Former Trump chief,"Steve Bannon, former chief strategist to President Donald Trump, has revealed Joe Biden's son emailed a shop owner who had his hard drive in an effort to get it back.

The revelations come as the New York Post this week released an expose detailing links between Joe Biden and his son who was paid at least $50,000 a month to sit on the board of a Ukrainian energy company who allegedly set up a meeting with the then-Vice President.

Information regarding Hunter Biden’s relationship with the Ukranian energy company was sourced from a collection of emails recovered from a laptop that was allegedly dropped off at a repair shop in 2019 and later given to the FBI.

It was a water-damaged MacBook Pro and the person who dropped it off never paid for the service and didn't retrieve it or a hard drive on which its contents were stored - according to the shop owner who said he repeatedly tried to contact the customer.
 
Sky News host Sharri Markson said the owner of the repair shop in Biden's home state of Delaware says when he did not hear back from the FBI, he made a copy of the hard drive and gave it to Donald Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
 

Emails on the laptop revealed that Hunter Biden had planned to introduce his father – the then-Vice President – to an executive at Ukrainian energy company Burisma, a company where Hunter served on the board of directors.

Publicly, Biden has said he's never spoken to his son about his overseas business dealings. These emails seem to indicate otherwise.
 
In one message sent by Vadym Pozharsky in April 2015, he wrote: ""Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent (sic) some time together. It's realty (sic) an honour and pleasure.""

In response to this news, Facebook and Twitter both censored the article from the New York Post, advising they were ""limiting the distribution"" of the story on their platforms until a third-party contractor can ""fact check"" the article.

Mr Bannon told Ms Markson, “Hunter Biden’s lawyer has come to us both with phone calls and with emails saying, ‘hey, I’ve got to get the hard drive back’.”

“This is not some Russian intelligence operation; they admit it’s their hard drive,” Mr Bannon said.

“We have the emails from the Lawyer, if we need to release them, we’ll release them.”",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_zhWHsfEa0U/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-22 11:48:31.995486,1.3333333333333333,"['PartisanRight', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanRight']",Right,False,1,oEdeHwzzM-g
