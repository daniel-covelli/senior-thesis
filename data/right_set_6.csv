qmKGVyiiBCY,Sky News Australia,UCO0akufu9MOzyz3nvGIXAAw,1604350608.0,Small margin of Democrat to Republican early-voters 'not looking good for Biden',"If there is a surge of republican votes on election day, as CBS, a mainstream American media is predicting, Donald Trump will be returned to presidency, according to Sky News host Paul Murray. 

 “The assumption has always been that Democrats are voting early and they are voting by a margin of 2-1,” Mr Murray said.

“But, if that’s the case, it means on election day, republicans vote 2-1, so you’ve got to have massive margins going into election day.""

Mr Murray showed a recently released CBS poll which revealed 66 per cent of Democrats had already voted, while 69 per cent of Republicans were planning to vote on election day.

“Our theory is holding up,” he said. 

“The Biden vote should be big margins in the places he needs to win, but if there is a Trump surge, CBS, lefty, mainstream media America is predicting, that if this is true, Donald Trump is returned to the presidency.

“He’d have 279 electoral college votes.

“If Joe Biden is so far ahead in the opinion polls, and he’s so far ahead in terms of those who identify themselves as Democrats to have voted already for him, the margins need to be big.”

Mr Murray gave an in-depth analysis of pre-polling and the early-vote in key states across the US ahead of the election.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qmKGVyiiBCY/hqdefault.jpg,2020-11-02 09:20:54.808342,Right,1.3333333333333333,"['PartisanRight', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanRight']",Right,False,1,K_iD_Z6qt0Q,1,Kyle Rittenhouse

Mr Trump responded by saying: ""We're rounding the corner. It's going away,"" adding that ""we can't close up our nation or we won't have one"".

“It is extraordinary, it’s almost like a cult movement and he’s like a cult leader and people are coming out in vast numbers,” Mr Hockey said. 

Mr Hockey said Trump went to five cities across the country on Sunday, and people in Florida were queued up waiting for his arrival from 7am right through until beyond 11:30pm. 

“It is building a momentum, there’s no doubt about that,” he said.

“He is hungry and it shows. He really wants people votes and that’s given him momentum in the last 48 hours.

“It’s really hard to read the impact of that momentum on the electoral votes.”",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kYc--HMJ-6E/hqdefault.jpg,2020-11-02 09:20:55.900952,Right,1.3333333333333333,"['PartisanRight', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanRight']",Right,False,4,weIC9w-PG7g,1,Kyle Rittenhouse

 “The assumption has always been that Democrats are voting early and they are voting by a margin of 2-1,” Mr Murray said.

“But, if that’s the case, it means on election day, republicans vote 2-1, so you’ve got to have massive margins going into election day.""

Mr Murray showed a recently released CBS poll which revealed 66 per cent of Democrats had already voted, while 69 per cent of Republicans were planning to vote on election day.

“Our theory is holding up,” he said. 

“The Biden vote should be big margins in the places he needs to win, but if there is a Trump surge, CBS, lefty, mainstream media America is predicting, that if this is true, Donald Trump is returned to the presidency.

“He’d have 279 electoral college votes.

“If Joe Biden is so far ahead in the opinion polls, and he’s so far ahead in terms of those who identify themselves as Democrats to have voted already for him, the margins need to be big.”

Mr Murray gave an in-depth analysis of pre-polling and the early-vote in key states across the US ahead of the election.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qmKGVyiiBCY/hqdefault.jpg,2020-11-02 09:20:55.901063,Right,1.3333333333333333,"['PartisanRight', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanRight']",Right,False,4,weIC9w-PG7g,1,Kyle Rittenhouse

Joe Biden has renewed his attack on President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic ahead of the presidential election on 3 November.

The Democratic candidate told the debate in Nashville, Tennessee: ""Anyone who's responsible for that many deaths should not remain president of the United States of America.

""He says we're, you know, learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it.""

Mr Trump responded by saying: ""We're rounding the corner. It's going away,"" adding that ""we can't close up our nation or we won't have one"".

“How can you have a guy whose son walks out with a billion and a half dollars to manage … whose son asked for $10 million dollars a year for introductory purposes”.

Speaking of Mr Biden’s alleged links to Hunter Biden’s Chinese dealings, the president asked how the Democratic candidate was ""supposed to be negotiating with China” given the compromising circumstances.

He claimed the communist nation must be hoping he doesn’t return to the White House, pointing out his administration had “taken in tens of billions of dollars a year, for the first time ever, from China”.

“It is building a momentum, there’s no doubt about that,” he said.

“He is hungry and it shows. He really wants people votes and that’s given him momentum in the last 48 hours.

Quotes used:

Joe Biden: ""They're gonna put y'all back in chains...""

Elizabeth Warren:  “This Administration's success will be judged on whether it can eliminate Kim's nuclear weapons and verify they are gone.”

Mike Bloomberg: “These kids think they’re going to get killed anyway because all their friends are getting killed...They just don’t have any long-term focus or anything. It’s a joke to have a gun. It’s a joke to pull a trigger.”

Elizabeth Warren:  “When Palestine and Hamas puts its rocket launchers next to hospitals, next to schools, they’re using their civilian population to protect their military assets, and I believe Israel has a right, at that point, to defend itself.”
