ℹ More About This Video: 

In the previous video, found here: https://youtu.be/ApSXJ2ienHI , criminal defense attorney, Robert Gruler, covered the First Degree Intentional Homicide statute. If one of the affirmative defenses apply from the first video, then it is possible that the first degree intentional homicide charged will be dropped to the second degree. 



In this video, Rob covers what the second degree intentional homicide statue means and how this statute could affect Kyle Rittenhouse's case. Rob also quickly explains the Wisconsin statute for self- defense which is going to very important for Kyle's case.

ℹ More About This Video: 

What is provocation? Provocation is similar to the self- defense statute. How could provocation affect Kyle Rittenhouse's case? Well, if Kyle was on the streets engaging in unlawful conduct that could provoke others to attack him then Kyle cannot claim self- defense. 



In this video, criminal defense attorney Robert Gruler explains what provocation is and how it could affect Kyle's case and why Rob believes that Kyle was not engaged in unlawful acts.

fmVGDjc379g,Zooming In with Simone Gao,UCVWMVBg1RPrDlakdmbyTKBA,1603958950.0,New Audio Proves Joe Biden Lied;  Implicated in Criminal Investigation |Zooming In with Simone Gao,"Over the past few weeks, stories have continued to unfold with information about the Biden family and their possible connections to Ukrainian and Chinese businesses. The stories center on #Hunter Biden, son of Democratic candidate Joe Biden. They began with an apparent link to a hard drive containing details of Hunter’s drug use and sexual activities with multiple women. The drive also included details of Hunter’s business dealings with a Ukrainian company and discussions over profit sharing possibly involving Joe Biden. Last weekend, information came out linking Hunter Biden to several billion-dollar business deals with Chinese companies, deals that may also involve the Biden family.

I have to admit, Looking through multiple papers and studying materials from both the American and Chinese sides brought serious concerns. To find out more, I spoke with Chinese sources who are familiar with the pinceling business operations in question. After considering all of this information, I came to the conclusion that Joe Biden may be deeply compromised. 

This is an extremely important topic for this election but also for government in general. The American public needs to know what the Chinese Communist Party is capable of and their systematic ways of achieving political goals. They need to understand that this can happen to many American politicians, whether Democrats or Republicans. This is not only an issue of a politician’s character.  It is a question of national security. 

The CCP attempts to influence American politicians for a purpose.  They want to control these leaders.  To do so, they use a methodology that has been tried extensively by the Party and has been proven very effective. 

What is it and how does it work? We begin with a look at several billion-dollar business deals between members of the Biden family and Chinese companies.  These are deals that happened after Joe Biden became the Vice President of the United States. Last Saturday, Hunter Biden’s former business partner, former Lieutenant of the US Navy, Tony Bobulinski, made this statement before the Trump/Biden presidential debate as an invited guest of the president...

ℹ More About This Video: 

Kyle Rittenhouse is still located in Illinois. While in Illinois he had an extradition hearing that was rescheduled for September 25, 2020. But, in Wisconsin the judge issued an arrest warrant for him and has set the bond at $2 million.   



Cases like Kyle's can take a very long time to resolve. For a 17 year old young man to spend possibly two years in jail waiting to resolve his case would be detrimental for his mental and physical health. That is why it is essential to get him out of custody ASAP.

ℹ More About This Video: 
On August 26th, Kyle Rittenhouse was arrested and charged with multiple counts of murder. On August 27th, the criminal complaint was filed, listing 6 counts with 5 victims and charging Kyle with a potential maximum of up to 170 years in prison.

In this video, criminal defense lawyer Robert Gruler analyzes the complaint paragraph by paragraph with photographic evidence illustrating the nature of the charges. But why did the prosecutors write a probable cause statement that reads like it was written by the defense? What can the defense do with this? Watch to find out!

In this video, criminal defense attorney, Robert Gruler, explains what the self- defense statute says and means in relation to Kyle Rittenhouse's case.

ℹ About This Video: 
The media and Joe Biden continue to claim that Donald Trump called neo- Nazi's ""fine people"" which is one of the main reasons that Trump is called a racist. But, according to the transcripts from the interview with Trump, this is false. 

Trump never endorsed neo- Nazi's. Joe Biden specifically brought up that one of the reason's Biden is running for president is because of this comment that Biden is claiming Trump made, but it is not true which is alarming since Biden is lying.

At the time, top Democrats, including Obama, argued that a president’s nomination should always be considered, no matter what year it is or which party is in charge of the Senate. After Ruth Bader Ginsburg died in September, it looks like their tune has changed!

Science does not have any concrete facts as to what may lurk tens of thousands of metres below the planet’s surface.
In fact, samples of minerals extracted from deep down are as valuable as those delivered from celestial objects by spacecraft.
But what prevents us from going as far down as that and taking a look?
And what has been revealed so far thanks to the deepest manmade well - the Kola Superdeep Borehole?

Barn Find Datsun 280z with only 350 Original Miles,"This is the rarest Datsun 280z Barn find ever recorded (as I've been told) with only 350 original miles! It was left in a barn near Hershey Pennsylvania before its first wash in 44 years! You'd expect this to be a complete detailing disaster because it was left untouched for so long...but the paint was in good condition despite being covered in filth and disgusting grime. In this barn find, we use AMMO Frothe to remove the first layer of dust and dirt to ensure the rubber seals did not leak if we power washed. Once confident, we power washed the paint, then compounded and polished with a Rupes polisher during our paint restoration. The Datsun 280z has since won several awards at Zcon and more information can be found at www.350mile280z.com.
