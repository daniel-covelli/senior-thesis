And he has even threatened NATO — the bedrock of America's global power. It's diplomatic disruption on an unprecedented scale. But even for America's shell-shocked allies, it may not be all bad. So just how much has Trump disrupted transatlantic relations? DW's Chief International Editor Richard Walker explains why Europe is praying for a Joe Biden win in the 2020 US election.

Mr Siracusa told Sky News while people might think having the former president campaign for Mr Biden would be effective in unifying voters, it was not a decisive move in terms of securing voter support. 

“Obama’s got the kiss of death when he’s campaigning for other people,” he said. 

“During his two administrations, most people, most Democrats didn’t want him around because he didn’t do them any favours.

“Whereas Americans tended to like Obama, they didn’t tend to think he had much of a glow effect, a halo effect on the people he supported.” 

Mr Siracusa said another downfall related to Mr Obama’s barracking for the Democrats was it gave “the impression that Biden is simply an Obama 2.0 administration and bringing the old crowd again, Hillary and everybody, which is probably true.”",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uxAS-xcDTzQ/hqdefault.jpg,2020-11-01 21:20:21.298723,Neutral,1.3333333333333333,"['PartisanRight', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanRight']",Right,False,3,vQe2VjOJGpU

Mr Siracusa told Sky News while people might think having the former president campaign for Mr Biden would be effective in unifying voters, it was not a decisive move in terms of securing voter support. 

“Obama’s got the kiss of death when he’s campaigning for other people,” he said. 

“During his two administrations, most people, most Democrats didn’t want him around because he didn’t do them any favours.

“Whereas Americans tended to like Obama, they didn’t tend to think he had much of a glow effect, a halo effect on the people he supported.” 

Mr Siracusa said another downfall related to Mr Obama’s barracking for the Democrats was it gave “the impression that Biden is simply an Obama 2.0 administration and bringing the old crowd again, Hillary and everybody, which is probably true.”",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uxAS-xcDTzQ/hqdefault.jpg,2020-11-01 21:20:21.912327,Neutral,1.3333333333333333,"['PartisanRight', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanRight']",Right,False,4,QOb4cie8-Rk
