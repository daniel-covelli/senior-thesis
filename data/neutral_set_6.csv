But while most of the Trumps are making headlines, one family member has managed to skirt the spotlight. 14-year-old Barron Trump is the only son of President Trump and the First Lady - and here's what America's First Kid is all about!

Barron Trump is one of five children, from Donald's three marriages. Barron's older brothers, Donald Jr. and Eric, are the children of Donald and his first wife, Ivana. Also from the first marriage is Ivanka, who works as an official assistant to the President, while her husband, Jared Kushner, is a senior adviser. 

Barron's two older brothers often appear in the spotlight due to their leading roles in The Trump Organization. And all three of the older kids made appearances during their father's campaign, speaking at both the 2016 and the 2020 Republican National Conventions. The siblings were also joined by their younger sister, Tiffany, from Donald's second marriage to Marla Maples, who spoke in support of her father, as well.

While Barron may have been absent from the official podium, we're certain he would have been speaking, too, if he were just a little older. And, it's not like he isn't familiar with being on TV… Keep watching to learn The Truth About Donald And Melania Trump's Only Son!

Just as the world has never experienced a United States President quite like Donald Trump, it’s not seen a First Lady like Melania Trump either. Despite being one of the most photographed women on the planet, she remains virtually unknown. But wealthy New York socialite Stephanie Winston Wolkoff is now controversially trying to change all that. She says she was “besties”” with Melania for 15 years, and because of their friendship was not only appointed a senior adviser to the First Lady, she was also asked to organise Trump’s presidential inauguration. But two years ago the friendship between the two women soured. Stephanie claims she was the victim of an orchestrated political hit and was bitterly disappointed when Melania abandoned her. Many are calling it a despicable act of revenge, but Stephanie has now written a tell-all book about the First Lady and her secrets, and as she explains to Liam Bartlett in an exclusive interview, there are plenty of secrets to tell about Melania and the Donald.

There aren't too many comedians who could boast that they've changed the face of comedy, but John Cleese can, even if he's far too modest to make such a claim. From Monty Python to Fawlty Towers, John Cleese has created some of the funniest and most enduring characters of our times. And at 75, he's showing no signs of retiring. He's just penned an autobiography, and while it explains a lot about the man, one thing he can’t explain is why John Cleese makes us laugh. John Cleese’s new book ‘So Anyway’ is available in all good bookstores.

Just as the world has never experienced a United States President quite like Donald Trump, it’s not seen a First Lady like Melania Trump either. Despite being one of the most photographed women on the planet, she remains virtually unknown. But wealthy New York socialite Stephanie Winston Wolkoff is now controversially trying to change all that. She says she was “besties”” with Melania for 15 years, and because of their friendship was not only appointed a senior adviser to the First Lady, she was also asked to organise Trump’s presidential inauguration. But two years ago the friendship between the two women soured. Stephanie claims she was the victim of an orchestrated political hit and was bitterly disappointed when Melania abandoned her. Many are calling it a despicable act of revenge, but Stephanie has now written a tell-all book about the First Lady and her secrets, and as she explains to Liam Bartlett in an exclusive interview, there are plenty of secrets to tell about Melania and the Donald.

Just as the world has never experienced a United States President quite like Donald Trump, it’s not seen a First Lady like Melania Trump either. Despite being one of the most photographed women on the planet, she remains virtually unknown. But wealthy New York socialite Stephanie Winston Wolkoff is now controversially trying to change all that. She says she was “besties”” with Melania for 15 years, and because of their friendship was not only appointed a senior adviser to the First Lady, she was also asked to organise Trump’s presidential inauguration. But two years ago the friendship between the two women soured. Stephanie claims she was the victim of an orchestrated political hit and was bitterly disappointed when Melania abandoned her. Many are calling it a despicable act of revenge, but Stephanie has now written a tell-all book about the First Lady and her secrets, and as she explains to Liam Bartlett in an exclusive interview, there are plenty of secrets to tell about Melania and the Donald.

There aren't too many comedians who could boast that they've changed the face of comedy, but John Cleese can, even if he's far too modest to make such a claim. From Monty Python to Fawlty Towers, John Cleese has created some of the funniest and most enduring characters of our times. And at 75, he's showing no signs of retiring. He's just penned an autobiography, and while it explains a lot about the man, one thing he can’t explain is why John Cleese makes us laugh. John Cleese’s new book ‘So Anyway’ is available in all good bookstores.

All told, his speech clocked in at about 75 minutes -- one of the longest in recent history -- during which he lambasted his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, took aim at the Obama administration and vowed to restore safety to the country at home and abroad amid what he said were a myriad of threats to its very fabric.

“How can you have a guy whose son walks out with a billion and a half dollars to manage … whose son asked for $10 million dollars a year for introductory purposes”.

Speaking of Mr Biden’s alleged links to Hunter Biden’s Chinese dealings, the president asked how the Democratic candidate was ""supposed to be negotiating with China” given the compromising circumstances.

He claimed the communist nation must be hoping he doesn’t return to the White House, pointing out his administration had “taken in tens of billions of dollars a year, for the first time ever, from China”.

The Biden campaign has strenuously denied their candidate was involved in any overseas business dealings with China.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Pce0buxb6As/hqdefault.jpg,2020-11-02 09:13:19.401740,Neutral,1.3333333333333333,"['PartisanRight', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanRight']",Right,False,1,jkqT1CBxFgE,4,GDP

“And Frankly, the riots that happened in Philadelphia over the last couple of days … this could not have been scripted better for the president.

“He should be pointing to this as an example of ‘hey, Pennsylvania, you need to be looking to me not just because Biden wants to get rid of all fracking, all fossil fuels’ … but also because this law and order thing plays really well in those rural and suburb areas of Pennsylvania.
