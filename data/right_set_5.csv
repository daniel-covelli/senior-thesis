yvciFjn2v98,TEDx Talks,UCsT0YIqwnpJCM-mx7-gSA4Q,1368653759.0,Immigration Reform: A Chance For a Better America: Andrea Guerrero at TEDxNashville,"The current national debate on whether and how to change our immigration laws presents us with an opportunity to not only fix a broken immigration system, but also to break a cycle of mistreatment of immigrants that is as old as this country. It's a chance for us to act on our shared values, model respect for others to our children, and be a better America. 

Andrea Guerrero is the Executive Director of Alliance San Diego. She leads an outstanding team that is building coalitions and mobilizing resources to achieve greater impact on the issues that matter.

Before joining Alliance San Diego, Ms. Guerrero was the Field & Policy Director of the ACLU of San Diego & Imperial Counties. Prior to that, she practiced immigration law before administrative, federal district and appellate courts. She is a graduate of UC Berkeley Law School (J.D. 1999), University of Texas LBJ School of Public Affairs (M.A. 1994), and Stanford University (B.A. 1992). Originally from Mexico City, Ms. Guerrero views the world from a binational, bicultural, and bilingual lens. She has dedicated her professional life to protecting civil rights and advancing social justice.

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yvciFjn2v98/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-30 11:39:26.594317,Right,0.0,"['Educational', 'Educational', 'Educational']",Neutral,False,3,QCceG764SAk

JbrDYkVgGQM,"Hacking Law Practice, LLC",UCz8KsDcRFXxzYO4guvCR-LA,1558754263.0,Five Mistakes NOT to Make at your Immigration Interview,"The five mistakes you don't want to make when you go to your immigration interview:

1. You don't want to forget anything, your documents especially. Go over the list that USCIS sends you and triple check that you have all of your paperwork. If you're missing documents, a lot of bad things can happen.

2. Don't guess at your interview. Especially when English isn't your primary language, it can be easy to misunderstand what the officer is asking. If you don't understand, ask them to restate the question. Answering wrongly can disqualify you from naturalizing or getting a green card.

3.Don't interrupt the officer. Each officer has their own rhythm, their own quirks, and their own ways of doing things. Go with the flow of what the officer is asking. Answer concisely. Interrupting the officer will make them upset. If you are confused by what they are asking look to your lawyer.

4.Never lie to the immigration officer. Lying to an officer can permanently disqualify you from ever receiving an immigration benefit. This is one of the reasons why it is good to have an immigration lawyer prepare you for your interview.

5.Never ask an officer for an answer in your interview. Treat it like a job interview. Dress professionally and act with respect towards the officer.

Unfortunately, one of the major factors in success or failure depends on the identity of your refugee ""judge"". 

One factor that's in your control is your choice of counsel. Academic research indicates that individuals that have a lawyer have a better chance of succeeding as opposed to those that are unrepresented. 

Ask your lawyer the tough questions, including specific numbers as to the number of hearings and appeals that they have handled. You owe it to yourself to obtain the best possible representation. 

Preparation is key. 

Don't overlook the quality of interpretation at the hearing. 

You and your lawyer should ensure that your documents and your allegations contained in your documents are consistent and complete. 

You and your lawyer should be tracking down information that corroborates your claim. 

You may want to explore the possibility of obtaining expert testimony. 

Educate yourself. Understand what's involved and the procedure. 

Your lawyer must know the facts and must know the case law, legislation and the applicable rules of procedure. Make sure your hearing is not your lawyer's first rodeo.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MMDx2UvM7_Y/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-30 11:39:27.438014,Right,0.0,['None'],Neutral,False,5,g1Ak0t7pajg

My Podcast: https://immigrationanswershow.com/

What makes some asylum cases stronger than others asylum cases? Hi, I'm Jim Hacking, immigration attorney here in St. Louis. We thought we'd shoot this video today to explain to you by telling you two stories about how asylum works in the United States. A lot of people have questions about asylum so we thought that the easiest way to set it forward for you would be to tell you the story of two different people and why we think one case is a strong asylum case and why the other one isn't such a strong case.  Let's start with Edie from Ethiopia. Edie came in the United States just a few months ago. While he was here there was a coup in Ethiopia, and the government changed, and the leaders of the new regime hate the people of the ethnic background of Edie. That is that there's been gang warlord fights in Ethiopia for years that at different times different entities come to power and now Edie's group is being oppressed. There's multiple news reports of gang violence towards people in Edie's ethnic group, and it really looks as if Edie were to return home that he could face persecution.  Edie told us a story of his uncle getting beaten and kidnapped in Ethiopia and only being released after his family paid $25,000 worth of ransom. Edie has some identifying marks that make him readily ascertainable as being a member of that group.  In that case Edie would have a pretty strong asylum case. This is a typical kind of a situation that we hear about in asylum. Asylum is designed to protect people from persecution when they go back to their home country and we think here Edie could really face persecution, and that we could document it both through news stories, reports of country conditions from the Department of State, and by demonstrating that people in Edie's family have already faced persecution. If Edie had ever faced persecution of his own based on his background in the past then we could demonstrate that as well.  With many things in asylum it's all about how much evidence you have and the quality of that evidence. So we would want to put together a really strong asylum application based on both country conditions and Edie's particular facts, and show that if Edie were to return home now that he would be in big trouble. We think Edie's case would probably get approved.  At the same time let's talk about Sam from Syria. Sam from Syria has been studying in the United States for the last four years on a valid F-1 student visa. It's about ready to expire because he's going to graduate and he's not been able to line up a job or any OPT to be able to work with an employer after he graduates. Sam comes to us and he says, ""Jim look, we are from Syria, me and my wife. If we were to return home to Syria things are really horrible, and because of the civil war there's been a lot of unrest and a lot of violence, and there's not a lot of government control, and we're really worried about what would happen to us if we come back to Syria.""   At that point we would go down a series of questions and ask Sam if he thinks that he's going to be persecuted based on a protected class like his race, or his religion, or his political opinion, those kind of things. A lot of times people in Sam's situation don't have any particularized reason to think that they're going to face persecution. They just basically come to us and say, ""Things are really rough back in my home country of Syria. Do you think I can get asylum?""  We think this would be a much harder case to win. Without any real evidence to show that Sam is going to be targeted because of who he is, because of his ethnic background, or his religious background, or membership in a social group, we think there's a real chance that an asylum case for Sam might not work. Now, there's other options that we might be able to get for him, but right now it wouldn't look like based on these facts that Sam is going to get asylum.  What do these two cases tell us? I think what they tell us is that the cases are pretty fact specific, that you have to be concerned that you establish enough evidence that the people are entitled to asylum, and that these are hard cases to make and that you need a whole lot of evidence and you need to put them together as best you can. If you have any questions about asylum, if you want to know what the chances are of your case getting asylum give us a call 314-961-8200 or you can email me  jim@hackinglawpractice.com  . Thanks.

vu1H33460eA,"Hacking Law Practice, LLC",UCz8KsDcRFXxzYO4guvCR-LA,1393612671.0,What makes an asylum case weak or strong?,"Our Website: https://hackinglawpractice.com/

My Podcast: https://immigrationanswershow.com/

What makes some asylum cases stronger than others asylum cases? Hi, I'm Jim Hacking, immigration attorney here in St. Louis. We thought we'd shoot this video today to explain to you by telling you two stories about how asylum works in the United States. A lot of people have questions about asylum so we thought that the easiest way to set it forward for you would be to tell you the story of two different people and why we think one case is a strong asylum case and why the other one isn't such a strong case.  Let's start with Edie from Ethiopia. Edie came in the United States just a few months ago. While he was here there was a coup in Ethiopia, and the government changed, and the leaders of the new regime hate the people of the ethnic background of Edie. That is that there's been gang warlord fights in Ethiopia for years that at different times different entities come to power and now Edie's group is being oppressed. There's multiple news reports of gang violence towards people in Edie's ethnic group, and it really looks as if Edie were to return home that he could face persecution.  Edie told us a story of his uncle getting beaten and kidnapped in Ethiopia and only being released after his family paid $25,000 worth of ransom. Edie has some identifying marks that make him readily ascertainable as being a member of that group.  In that case Edie would have a pretty strong asylum case. This is a typical kind of a situation that we hear about in asylum. Asylum is designed to protect people from persecution when they go back to their home country and we think here Edie could really face persecution, and that we could document it both through news stories, reports of country conditions from the Department of State, and by demonstrating that people in Edie's family have already faced persecution. If Edie had ever faced persecution of his own based on his background in the past then we could demonstrate that as well.  With many things in asylum it's all about how much evidence you have and the quality of that evidence. So we would want to put together a really strong asylum application based on both country conditions and Edie's particular facts, and show that if Edie were to return home now that he would be in big trouble. We think Edie's case would probably get approved.  At the same time let's talk about Sam from Syria. Sam from Syria has been studying in the United States for the last four years on a valid F-1 student visa. It's about ready to expire because he's going to graduate and he's not been able to line up a job or any OPT to be able to work with an employer after he graduates. Sam comes to us and he says, ""Jim look, we are from Syria, me and my wife. If we were to return home to Syria things are really horrible, and because of the civil war there's been a lot of unrest and a lot of violence, and there's not a lot of government control, and we're really worried about what would happen to us if we come back to Syria.""   At that point we would go down a series of questions and ask Sam if he thinks that he's going to be persecuted based on a protected class like his race, or his religion, or his political opinion, those kind of things. A lot of times people in Sam's situation don't have any particularized reason to think that they're going to face persecution. They just basically come to us and say, ""Things are really rough back in my home country of Syria. Do you think I can get asylum?""  We think this would be a much harder case to win. Without any real evidence to show that Sam is going to be targeted because of who he is, because of his ethnic background, or his religious background, or membership in a social group, we think there's a real chance that an asylum case for Sam might not work. Now, there's other options that we might be able to get for him, but right now it wouldn't look like based on these facts that Sam is going to get asylum.  What do these two cases tell us? I think what they tell us is that the cases are pretty fact specific, that you have to be concerned that you establish enough evidence that the people are entitled to asylum, and that these are hard cases to make and that you need a whole lot of evidence and you need to put them together as best you can. If you have any questions about asylum, if you want to know what the chances are of your case getting asylum give us a call 314-961-8200 or you can email me  jim@hackinglawpractice.com  . Thanks.

There are a number of theories about these murders including those involving psychopathy, narcissism, rage, impulsivity, and infidelity.

The details of these murders are horrific. In 2018, Chris Watts (33 at the time) murdered his wife (Shanann Watts, 34, who was 15 weeks pregnant), and his daughters (Bella, 4 & Celeste, 3). Chris was involved in an affair at the time with Nichol Lee Kessinger (30 at the time).

Psychopathy:

There are two types of psychopathy: Factor 1 (primary, interpersonal affective) and Factor 2 (lifestyle, antisocial) psychopathy. Factor 1 psychopathy has characteristics like grandiosity, pathological lying, manipulation, a superficial charm, callous, unemotional, low neuroticism and lack of guilt or remorse. Factor 2 psychopathy has a parasitic lifestyle, being prone to boredom, sensation seeking, impulsivity, irresponsibility, a failure to have long term goals, poor behavioral controls, and criminal versatility.

Narcissism:

There are two types of narcissism: With grandiose narcissism we see characteristics like being extroverted, socially bold, self-confident, having a superficial charm, being resistant to criticism, and being callous and unemotional. Vulnerable narcissism is characterized by shame, anger, aggression, hypersensitivity, a tendency to be introverted, defensive, avoidant, anxious, depressed, socially awkward, and shy.

IDm4KDZVmoI,Dr. Todd Grande,UCC_0vyFTKk1Nlodo4QsiQkw,1554191017.0,Casey Anthony Murder Case | Mental State & Personality | Guilty or Not?,"This video answers the question: Can I talk about the Casey Anthony murder? Casey Anthony was charged with killing her two-year-old daughter, Caylee Anthony. This crime allegedly took place in 2008. I'll be taking a look at a lot of different factors in this case including potential mental health and personality factors, but just to be clear I'm not diagnosing Casey Anthony or anyone else involved in this case. 

In 2008, Casey Anthony was 18 years old and Caylee Anthony her daughter was 2 years old. They lived with Casey's parents, Cindy and George Anthony. From an outside observer’s point of view, this case started on July 15, 2008, when Cindy Anthony called the police and reported that her granddaughter was missing for 31 days. 

The next day charges of making a false statement to law enforcement were filed against Casey as she lied during the investigation. 
in October of 2015, she would be charged with first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse, and aggravated manslaughter of a child. In December, in a wooded area near their house, Caylee's body was discovered. The trial which started in 2011. There were really two theories of the crime that kind of emerged. On the state side their theory was that Casey bought chloroform used it on Caylee and then suffocated her and on the defense side they said that it was an accidental drowning.  The prosecution rested on June 15, 2011 and 15 days later the defense rested. The jury found that Casey Anthony was not guilty of any of the homicide or homicide related charges, but rather providing false information to a law enforcement officer. So she was convicted of four counts of lying to law enforcement and sentenced to one year per count, but when taking into account how long she'd already been in jail and the good behavior time she'd earned, she was released shortly after the verdict.

Was Ted Bundy  special?
What evidence supports the theory that Ted Bundy was psychopathic, narcissistic, or had bipolar symptoms?
Why was he able to evade detection and commit so many heinous crimes?
Why is Ted Bundy fascinating to so many?
Why did so many people believe that Ted Bundy was innocent?",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uxp_gZN8H5k/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-30 11:39:41.248712,Right,5.0,['AntiSJW'],Far Right,False,4,tVsceck-wJI

Was Ted Bundy  special?
What evidence supports the theory that Ted Bundy was psychopathic, narcissistic, or had bipolar symptoms?
Why was he able to evade detection and commit so many heinous crimes?
Why is Ted Bundy fascinating to so many?
Why did so many people believe that Ted Bundy was innocent?",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uxp_gZN8H5k/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-30 11:39:41.580111,Right,5.0,['AntiSJW'],Far Right,False,5,yzwEzK80B8E

IDm4KDZVmoI,Dr. Todd Grande,UCC_0vyFTKk1Nlodo4QsiQkw,1554191017.0,Casey Anthony Murder Case | Mental State & Personality | Guilty or Not?,"This video answers the question: Can I talk about the Casey Anthony murder? Casey Anthony was charged with killing her two-year-old daughter, Caylee Anthony. This crime allegedly took place in 2008. I'll be taking a look at a lot of different factors in this case including potential mental health and personality factors, but just to be clear I'm not diagnosing Casey Anthony or anyone else involved in this case. 

In 2008, Casey Anthony was 18 years old and Caylee Anthony her daughter was 2 years old. They lived with Casey's parents, Cindy and George Anthony. From an outside observer’s point of view, this case started on July 15, 2008, when Cindy Anthony called the police and reported that her granddaughter was missing for 31 days. 

The next day charges of making a false statement to law enforcement were filed against Casey as she lied during the investigation. 
in October of 2015, she would be charged with first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse, and aggravated manslaughter of a child. In December, in a wooded area near their house, Caylee's body was discovered. The trial which started in 2011. There were really two theories of the crime that kind of emerged. On the state side their theory was that Casey bought chloroform used it on Caylee and then suffocated her and on the defense side they said that it was an accidental drowning.  The prosecution rested on June 15, 2011 and 15 days later the defense rested. The jury found that Casey Anthony was not guilty of any of the homicide or homicide related charges, but rather providing false information to a law enforcement officer. So she was convicted of four counts of lying to law enforcement and sentenced to one year per count, but when taking into account how long she'd already been in jail and the good behavior time she'd earned, she was released shortly after the verdict.

What role did trauma, psychopathy, narcissism, and borderline personality traits play in turning Aileen Wuornos into a serial killer?

Narcissism:

There are two types of narcissism: With grandiose narcissism we see characteristics like being extroverted, socially bold, self-confident, having a superficial charm, being resistant to criticism, and being callous and unemotional. Vulnerable narcissism is characterized by shame, anger, aggression, hypersensitivity, a tendency to be introverted, defensive, avoidant, anxious, depressed, socially awkward, and shy.

Psychopathy:

There are two types of psychopathy: Factor 1 (primary, interpersonal affective) and Factor 2 (lifestyle, antisocial) psychopathy. Factor 1 psychopathy has characteristics like grandiosity, pathological lying, manipulation, a superficial charm, callous, unemotional, low neuroticism and lack of guilt or remorse. Factor 2 psychopathy has a parasitic lifestyle, being prone to boredom, sensation seeking, impulsivity, irresponsibility, a failure to have long term goals, poor behavioral controls, and criminal versatility.

Borderline Personality Disorder:

In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), we see nine symptom criteria for borderline personality disorder and five have to be met for a diagnosis. The symptom criteria include frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, unstable relationships, identity disturbance, impulsivity in two areas that are potentially self-damaging, suicidal behavior, affective instability, chronic feelings of emptiness, inappropriate or intense anger or difficulty controlling anger, and paranoid ideation or dissociation. Borderline personality disorder is a Cluster B personality disorder, so it’s in the same cluster is antisocial, narcissistic, and histrionic personality disorders.

Ted Bundy's behavior, as documented in the special and in other resources, has been discussed and analyzed by many over the years. I'll try to answer several questions including:

Was Ted Bundy  special?
What evidence supports the theory that Ted Bundy was psychopathic, narcissistic, or had bipolar symptoms?
Why was he able to evade detection and commit so many heinous crimes?
Why is Ted Bundy fascinating to so many?
Why did so many people believe that Ted Bundy was innocent?",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Uxp_gZN8H5k/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-30 11:39:42.135788,Right,5.0,['AntiSJW'],Far Right,False,6,j7UgEAnYz58

There are a number of theories about these murders including those involving psychopathy, narcissism, rage, impulsivity, and infidelity.

The details of these murders are horrific. In 2018, Chris Watts (33 at the time) murdered his wife (Shanann Watts, 34, who was 15 weeks pregnant), and his daughters (Bella, 4 & Celeste, 3). Chris was involved in an affair at the time with Nichol Lee Kessinger (30 at the time).

Psychopathy:

There are two types of psychopathy: Factor 1 (primary, interpersonal affective) and Factor 2 (lifestyle, antisocial) psychopathy. Factor 1 psychopathy has characteristics like grandiosity, pathological lying, manipulation, a superficial charm, callous, unemotional, low neuroticism and lack of guilt or remorse. Factor 2 psychopathy has a parasitic lifestyle, being prone to boredom, sensation seeking, impulsivity, irresponsibility, a failure to have long term goals, poor behavioral controls, and criminal versatility.

Narcissism:

There are two types of narcissism: With grandiose narcissism we see characteristics like being extroverted, socially bold, self-confident, having a superficial charm, being resistant to criticism, and being callous and unemotional. Vulnerable narcissism is characterized by shame, anger, aggression, hypersensitivity, a tendency to be introverted, defensive, avoidant, anxious, depressed, socially awkward, and shy.

IDm4KDZVmoI,Dr. Todd Grande,UCC_0vyFTKk1Nlodo4QsiQkw,1554191017.0,Casey Anthony Murder Case | Mental State & Personality | Guilty or Not?,"This video answers the question: Can I talk about the Casey Anthony murder? Casey Anthony was charged with killing her two-year-old daughter, Caylee Anthony. This crime allegedly took place in 2008. I'll be taking a look at a lot of different factors in this case including potential mental health and personality factors, but just to be clear I'm not diagnosing Casey Anthony or anyone else involved in this case. 

In 2008, Casey Anthony was 18 years old and Caylee Anthony her daughter was 2 years old. They lived with Casey's parents, Cindy and George Anthony. From an outside observer’s point of view, this case started on July 15, 2008, when Cindy Anthony called the police and reported that her granddaughter was missing for 31 days. 

The next day charges of making a false statement to law enforcement were filed against Casey as she lied during the investigation. 
in October of 2015, she would be charged with first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse, and aggravated manslaughter of a child. In December, in a wooded area near their house, Caylee's body was discovered. The trial which started in 2011. There were really two theories of the crime that kind of emerged. On the state side their theory was that Casey bought chloroform used it on Caylee and then suffocated her and on the defense side they said that it was an accidental drowning.  The prosecution rested on June 15, 2011 and 15 days later the defense rested. The jury found that Casey Anthony was not guilty of any of the homicide or homicide related charges, but rather providing false information to a law enforcement officer. So she was convicted of four counts of lying to law enforcement and sentenced to one year per count, but when taking into account how long she'd already been in jail and the good behavior time she'd earned, she was released shortly after the verdict.

qAYbz_9YxOk,Dr. Todd Grande,UCC_0vyFTKk1Nlodo4QsiQkw,1553418600.0,"Menendez Brothers Murder Case, Ethics, & Mental Health","This video answers the question: Can I describe the case of the Menendez brothers and the ethical considerations with mental health treatment and confidentiality circumstances in that case? It is an interesting case because it involves parricide, which is a rare type of homicide where children kill their parents. It's also interesting because it weaves the mental health components with ethics and confidentiality into the law.

Facts of the Case:
This case goes back to 1989, when two brothers Lyle Menendez (21 at the time) and Eric Menendez (18 at the time) lived in a Beverly Hills mansion with their parents Jose and Kitty Menendez. On August 18, 1989, the brothers bought two shotguns from a sporting goods store in San Diego. Two days later, Sunday night August 20, 1989 the crime took place. Jose was seated on a couch in the family room sleeping and Kitty was laying down with her head on his lap. One of the brothers aimed the 12-gauge shotgun at Jose, fired the shotgun, and struck him in the left elbow and the right arm. The other brother walked up behind Jose and shot him in the back of the head. Because of the shooting, Kitty woke up and she tried to flee, but she was injured by shots fired by the brothers. She was not killed at that time, so the brothers went out to their car because they ran out of ammunition before they could kill their mother. They reloaded the shotguns with birdshot came back in and shot her in the head several times. After Lyle and Erik killed their parents, they shot both Jose and Kitty each in the knee. They called the police and made an effort to cover up their crimes.

In 1996, a jury returned a guilty verdict and the brothers both received two consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole.

He murdered 17 people from 1978 to 1991, was arrested, sentenced to prison, and while in prison was murdered by another inmate. During the hearings to determine if Jeffrey Dahmer met the legal definition for insanity, mental health professionals speculated that he had a number of disorders including: borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, schizotypal personality disorder, psychotic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance use disorder, and others diagnoses. Later there was speculation that he may have schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, which is known today as schizoaffective disorder.

Just as the world has never experienced a United States President quite like Donald Trump, it’s not seen a First Lady like Melania Trump either. Despite being one of the most photographed women on the planet, she remains virtually unknown. But wealthy New York socialite Stephanie Winston Wolkoff is now controversially trying to change all that. She says she was “besties”” with Melania for 15 years, and because of their friendship was not only appointed a senior adviser to the First Lady, she was also asked to organise Trump’s presidential inauguration. But two years ago the friendship between the two women soured. Stephanie claims she was the victim of an orchestrated political hit and was bitterly disappointed when Melania abandoned her. Many are calling it a despicable act of revenge, but Stephanie has now written a tell-all book about the First Lady and her secrets, and as she explains to Liam Bartlett in an exclusive interview, there are plenty of secrets to tell about Melania and the Donald.

The President of the United States is often referred to as the most powerful man in the world. But Donald Trump’s niece, Mary Trump says the current POTUS is really the most dangerous man in the world. She is so troubled by Trump’s abuse of his position that she says it’s her patriotic duty to take him down. And to do that she has written a brutal tell-all memoir. As Liam Bartlett discovers in an Australian television exclusive interview, the book is the ultimate insider’s account of a truly dysfunctional family. But it has added substance because Doctor Mary Trump is also a clinical psychologist. Her analysis of how her Uncle Don became Uncle Sam is not just a page-turner, it’s a horror story.

There was little Jeffrey Epstein wouldn’t do to satisfy his lust for young women and girls. It included spending millions of dollars masterminding a worldwide sex-trafficking operation. Countless innocent lives were destroyed. A year ago Epstein was arrested and a month later he died in custody. Investigators though refused to let this scandal go to the grave with him. Instead they shifted their attention to his high-profile friends. One of them is the Queen’s son, Prince Andrew, who continues to dodge requests from the FBI for an interview. But late this week there was a significant breakthrough in the case with the arrest of socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.  She’s accused of being Epstein’s right-hand woman and has been charged with multiple child sex offences. As Tara Brown reports, for the first time in a long time, the victims in this wicked saga are feeling relief rather than terror.

In 1995, Maria Farmer met Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Epstein claimed to help manage Victoria’s Secret with Maxwell as his model scout. But it was a ruse: Maxwell was procuring girls for Epstein. When Maria went to the FBI, she was the very first victim to officially report Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell to the authorities. But by going to police, Maria felt the full force of Ghislaine Maxwell’s fury.

About this Video
------------------------------------------------------
I know a lot of other videos out there have some of these clips in them (some far more artfully done by the way! ) ... but I wanted one with ALL of them spliced together chronologically because I think the story they tell is really fascinating and inspiring. Whatever you choose to believe or not on what the media reports about him in 2016, weigh that against Mr. Trump's own words from interviews going back 30+ years.

** Copies/Reposts (just for reference, view counts):
------------------------------------------------------
I still find it somewhat odd people would copy this video vs just link to it but viewcount/spreading the word is the most important thing... so very cool!! If anyone else finds other copies please chime in so we can tally up the counts again!  Here are the copies I'm aware of:
