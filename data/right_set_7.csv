Mr Murray pointed to multiple media reports in the US which suggest the Democrats “have the edge” judging from early voting numbers.

“So apparently the election is over,” Mr Murray said.

Mr Murray said the latest “actual vote numbers” from a number of US states show “that is not the case”.

“In Wisconsin, more Republicans have asked for a (mail-in) ballot, and so far the results would suggest that the margins are that Trump is actually leading in Wisconsin,” he said.

Mr Murray also pointed to “supposedly knife-edge” states such as Arizona and Georgia, where the margins are “not two to one” regarding both the number of people who have requested a ballot and the number of people who have returned a ballot.

“This is a picture which is repeated over and over again,” he said.

“You have heard a narrative over and over again that early voting equals Democrat surge, the reality in the states is that it is not a two to one margin.”",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1cO1CApPKKU/hqdefault.jpg,2020-11-02 18:57:25.183179,Right,1.3333333333333333,"['PartisanRight', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanRight']",Right,True,1,avOmiddPZz4,0,Electoral College

Watch more of our election coverage: http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

In the 2000 US presidential election, the Democratic candidate got half a million more votes than the Republican. The Democrat lost. Sixteen years later the same thing happened again. In the US, if you run for president, it does not actually matter how many people in the country vote for you. What matters instead is an arcane system for selecting America’s head of state called the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is the reason the US has something called “swing states,” and it’s the reason those places get to decide the future of the country. It’s the reason presidential candidates almost never campaign in the country’s biggest cities. And more recently, it’s also the reason that Republican candidates have been able to eke out victories in the presidential election without actually getting the most votes.

The Electoral College makes some Americans’ votes more powerful than others. In fact, that’s part of the reason we have it to begin with; in the country’s early years, the Electoral College helped give the votes of Southern Whites more weight than the votes of Northerners. The idea at its core, that certain votes simply matter more than others, is baked into the American tradition. In the 2020 election, it may decide the winner.

The historian Alexander Keyssar’s book “Why Do We Still Have the Electoral College?” takes you through the history and function of the Electoral College: https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674660151

For the bite-sized version of that history, Keyssar also wrote this piece in the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/opinion/electoral-college-racism-white-supremacy.html

The Times also had a great interactive feature on where the 2020 candidates actually spent money: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/17/us/politics/trump-biden-campaign-ad-spending.html

Pew has a breakdown of how democracies around the world elect their head of state, which really shows what an oddball the US is: https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/22/among-democracies-u-s-stands-out-in-how-it-chooses-its-head-of-state/

qmKGVyiiBCY,Sky News Australia,UCO0akufu9MOzyz3nvGIXAAw,1604350608.0,Small margin of Democrat to Republican early-voters 'not looking good for Biden',"If there is a surge of republican votes on election day, as CBS, a mainstream American media is predicting, Donald Trump will be returned to presidency, according to Sky News host Paul Murray. 

 “The assumption has always been that Democrats are voting early and they are voting by a margin of 2-1,” Mr Murray said.

“But, if that’s the case, it means on election day, republicans vote 2-1, so you’ve got to have massive margins going into election day.""

 “The assumption has always been that Democrats are voting early and they are voting by a margin of 2-1,” Mr Murray said.

“But, if that’s the case, it means on election day, republicans vote 2-1, so you’ve got to have massive margins going into election day.""

Jim believes that the election is ‘closer than you think’ and explains why the polls could be wrong like they were in 2016. Jim predicts that Trump is likely to win the US presidential election this time around too. 

This interview was released to subscribers of Rock Stock Insider and Hard Money Trader, to learn more about Shae Russell’s special investment newsletters check out the links below.

Rock Stock Insider - https://www.dailyreckoning.com.au/investment-services/rock-stock-insider-newsletter/
Hard Money Trader - https://www.dailyreckoning.com.au/investment-services/hard-money-trader/

Step away from the headlines, they aren’t useful. It’s nothing but noise and misdirection.

Ignore the polls, cause they’re probably wrong.

Steady your hand investors, the markets will be twitchy over the next few weeks…but after watching today’s four exclusive interviews, you shouldn’t be.

Over the past two weeks I’ve spoken to some world-renowned experts and a couple of local Aussie experts.

My suggestion to you is make yourself a cuppa and set aside an hour, or carve out some time over the weekend so you really tune in. Hear what Jim, Rick, Bron and Hedley have to say. The outcome of the US election is so much more than who gets the Oval Office.

Let’s get started.

Jim Rickards, Editor of Strategic Intelligence Australia:

Way back in 2016, Jim told the world Donald Trump was going to win the US election. This statement flew in the face of the polls and the media that overwhelmingly favoured Hillary Clinton. Jim could make this call because few people understand the minutiae details like him. And in today’s interview, he breaks down exactly how the polls get it wrong.

Jim says the 2020 election is going to be a nail-biting finish and that you can’t rule Trump out just yet, despite what the polls say. If Biden wins, Jim says there’s a titbit in his tax policies that could see US investors dump stocks before Christmas…which would only increase the volatility in the markets.

“If you look at Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, the point is that the polls are so close in those states … you can make a case for Donald Trump winning in every one of those states.

“All the lefties who have been saying for months and right up until now that there’s no way that Donald Trump will be reelected, you can see in some of the media commentary now they’re thinking ‘oh hang on look out, just maybe’.

LlQX4fmRrpI,Jack Chapple,UCsdJxGA27BSz7IiPMn9VV1g,1586240663.0,"A Bigger Crisis Is On The Horizon, And It Will Last For Decades","As the news talks about enforcing mandatory lockdowns, and handing out money to citizens…

There has been a problem that has been rapidly expanding in the background of all of this news.

…And It is a problem that the world has never really seen before.

In fact… it might create a crisis that won’t just be felt in the next week, the next month, or even the next year...

but it might be felt for several decades to come…

During World War 2, Britain was in the thick of war against the axis powers. However, Britain ran into a roadblock…they were quickly running out of money. 

So, they began looking to borrow money from both their own future taxpayers, as well as the United States & Canada. In 1941 Britain began accepting loans and taking on debt to fund the war… and by 1945 Britain had taken on nearly $10 Billion dollars worth of debt from its creditors. 

At this point in time, Britains debt to GDP ratio was a whopping 200% meaning that the country had twice as much debt, as its entire market value of all  its goods and services it produces over an entire year.

And just some perspective for you, is that the World Bank states that once a country reaches above 77% debt to GDP ratio, its economy will begin to slow down from such a large portion of its revenue going towards paying down its debt.

Anyways, after the war ended, Britain had amassed a debt that was so large, that they couldn’t pay it back in 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, or even 20 years. On December 29, 2006, Britain made its last repayment on its World War 2 debt to The United States and Canada. 

This means that British taxpayers from 1945, up until 2006 had a small portion of their tax bill every year, go towards the Debt that the country accumulated in the 1940’s. 

And for about a decade after the war, Britains economy was drastically hindered, in part due to their outstanding debt that they incurred. However, their economy eventually recovered thanks to an influx of taxpayers, called the baby boomers, as well as some economic reforms and infrastructure investments. 

But a lot of the times when a country accrues as much debt as britain did, they are not so lucky.

In 2001 Argentina’s debt to GDP ratio reached a high of 166%, which caused the country to default on over $100 Billion dollars worth of debt. This  default made capital move out of the country, and soon the nation saw millions of people enter poverty while unemployment reached a high of 19%. And to this day, Argentina hasn’t fully recovered from its debt crisis that it went through nearly 20 years ago.

And similar stories can be said for Greece in 2012, Zimbabwe in 2006, Venezuala in 2017, and Russia in 1998.

The point I am trying to make here is that even though debt can be a good thing to take on… in order to solve today’s serious problems…it will almost always have serious long-term consequences that could last for years or even decades. 

So now, lets bring this back to the United States. So whether you know it or not, America essentially runs on debt. Historically, America’s economy has been so big, and has grown so fast, that taking out tens of billions of debt here or there hasn’t really been much of a big deal because it was such a small percentage of the countries overall Economy. For example In 2006, The United States had a relatively healthy Debt to GDP ratio of about 60%. But then…the financial crisis hit. During the financial crisis, the United states began scrambling for ways to pump money back into the economy… so it began taking out hundreds of billions of dollars worth of debt. 


And some people might think that The United States, along with every other country that took out debt to get through the financial crisis, has paid off some of their debt since 2008. But actually, the opposite of that is true. You see, since the financial crisis, many developed countries throughout the world have been accruing more and more debt every year, while economic growth has slowed. This means that many countries may actually find it more difficult to pay off their debt now, than they did during the financial crisis.

Too Long, End of Transcript.

But the U.S. revoked his passport when he stopped through Russia, effectively stranding him there. Snowden has lived as an exile in Moscow ever since. He tells us his story.

Earlier this month, the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Snowden alleging that his newly released memoir, “Permanent Record,” violates the nondisclosure agreements he signed with the federal government when he was a National Security Agency employee. The Justice Department also argued that they are entitled to all of Snowden’s book profits. Democracy Now!’s Amy Goodman and Juan González speak with Snowden about the lawsuit.

I do not know the young man who acted in what appears to be self-defense by several video clips. We make no claims or judgements other than those listed here.

This young man is being charged with multiple murders as well as other charges. In my opinion, all needless and avoidable.

Self-defense and our claim to it, begins long before a trigger is pulled. Investigators look at why you were there, what role was played by each involved. Did you add fuel or seek peace? You may feel you are right, but if judge, jury and others don’t see it your way, you are smoked. Seek peace. Think what this entails long before the act of defense.

Loading up armed and rolling into a state and hood other than your own is 100% avoidable. That said, he also had a right to be there, but not armed. The law matters.

A group of armed pro-Trump and militia activists marched to the City Hall in Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday. They were confronted by Black Lives Matter  counter-protesters.

Rival protesters were filmed verbally confronting each other before police officers showed up prompting militia leader Dylan Stevens, known as the Angry Viking, to say his group was leaving the area.

Armed militias were present in various locations across the country during the recent protests against racism and police brutality.

In late August, two people were shot dead and several others injured in Kenosha, Wisconsin, after a civilian armed with a rifle opened fire on demonstrators.

Portland rioters repeatedly tossed rocks, fireworks, and other objects at officers on Saturday as unrest continued to fester in the city, police said.

Hundreds of demonstrators blocked traffic near a law enforcement precinct and hurled firecrackers, stones, and soda cans at officers attempting to break up the disturbance, according to a Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office press release. Officers were also struck with metal ball bearings from slingshots, the release detailed.

fmVGDjc379g,Zooming In with Simone Gao,UCVWMVBg1RPrDlakdmbyTKBA,1603958950.0,New Audio Proves Joe Biden Lied;  Implicated in Criminal Investigation |Zooming In with Simone Gao,"Over the past few weeks, stories have continued to unfold with information about the Biden family and their possible connections to Ukrainian and Chinese businesses. The stories center on #Hunter Biden, son of Democratic candidate Joe Biden. They began with an apparent link to a hard drive containing details of Hunter’s drug use and sexual activities with multiple women. The drive also included details of Hunter’s business dealings with a Ukrainian company and discussions over profit sharing possibly involving Joe Biden. Last weekend, information came out linking Hunter Biden to several billion-dollar business deals with Chinese companies, deals that may also involve the Biden family.

I have to admit, Looking through multiple papers and studying materials from both the American and Chinese sides brought serious concerns. To find out more, I spoke with Chinese sources who are familiar with the pinceling business operations in question. After considering all of this information, I came to the conclusion that Joe Biden may be deeply compromised. 

This is an extremely important topic for this election but also for government in general. The American public needs to know what the Chinese Communist Party is capable of and their systematic ways of achieving political goals. They need to understand that this can happen to many American politicians, whether Democrats or Republicans. This is not only an issue of a politician’s character.  It is a question of national security. 

The CCP attempts to influence American politicians for a purpose.  They want to control these leaders.  To do so, they use a methodology that has been tried extensively by the Party and has been proven very effective. 

What is it and how does it work? We begin with a look at several billion-dollar business deals between members of the Biden family and Chinese companies.  These are deals that happened after Joe Biden became the Vice President of the United States. Last Saturday, Hunter Biden’s former business partner, former Lieutenant of the US Navy, Tony Bobulinski, made this statement before the Trump/Biden presidential debate as an invited guest of the president...

On March 9, 2016, the worlds of Go and artificial intelligence collided in South Korea for an extraordinary best-of-five-game competition, coined The DeepMind Challenge Match. Hundreds of millions of people around the world watched as a legendary Go master took on an unproven AI challenger for the first time in history.

Directed by Greg Kohs and with an original score by Academy Award nominee Hauschka, AlphaGo chronicles a journey from the halls of Oxford, through the backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of DeepMind in London, and ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul.

Hillsdale College is an independent institution of higher learning founded in 1844 by men and women “grateful to God for the inestimable blessings” resulting from civil and religious liberty and “believing that the diffusion of learning is essential to the perpetuity of these blessings.” It pursues the stated object of the founders: “to furnish all persons who wish, irrespective of nation, color, or sex, a literary, scientific, [and] theological education” outstanding among American colleges “and to combine with this such moral and social instruction as will best develop the minds and improve the hearts of its pupils.” As a nonsectarian Christian institution, Hillsdale College maintains “by precept and example” the immemorial teachings and practices of the Christian faith.

The College also considers itself a trustee of our Western philosophical and theological inheritance tracing to Athens and Jerusalem, a heritage finding its clearest expression in the American experiment of self-government under law.

By training the young in the liberal arts, Hillsdale College prepares students to become leaders worthy of that legacy. By encouraging the scholarship of its faculty, it contributes to the preservation of that legacy for future generations. By publicly defending that legacy, it enlists the aid of other friends of free civilization and thus secures the conditions of its own survival and independence.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SQDEDR0JXdE/hqdefault.jpg,2020-11-02 18:58:02.459679,Right,2.0,['PartisanRight'],Far Right,False,3,JRmlcEBAiIs,3,Kirstie Alley

Are Trump allies peddling Russian disinformation about the Bidens?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQX-XSCMMdY

Why talking to Ukrainian officials disproves the Trump narrative on Biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUSU_JDClE
--------
Pam Bondi, the former attorney general of Florida who is a member of the Trump impeachment legal team, outlined on Jan. 27 the concerns she said the president had about potential corruption on the part of the Bidens in Ukraine. Bondi pointed to numerous news reports raising questions about Hunter Biden’s appointment to the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma. The move “looks nepotistic at best, nefarious at worst,” Bondi said, speaking on the Senate floor during the impeachment trial. 

While some ethics experts have said Hunter Biden’s seat on the Burisma board could raise the appearance of a conflict of interest, independent news reports have found no wrongdoing by Hunter Biden or former vice president Joe Biden. 

Democrats argue Trump used the idea of corruption as a cover for efforts to get Ukraine to investigate his political rival. Trump’s defense team is presenting their arguments as part of the Senate impeachment trial. The trial has entered a pivotal week as his defense team resumes its case and senators face a critical vote on whether to hear witnesses or proceed directly to a vote that is widely expected to end in his acquittal. The articles of impeachment charge Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The House of Representatives impeached the president in December on those two counts.

We tested it, here's what happened","Just about everyone who uses popular social media apps like Facebook and Instagram can tell you an anecdote about advertisements popping into their feeds that are so acutely targeted to them it’s like the apps are listening to their conversations.

Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called it a ‘conspiracy theory’ that the app accesses the microphone on a person’s phone to listen to conversations and, in turn, target news feeds with related ads.

But it happens so often to people that it gives even the least conspiracy-minded pause, people like WWL-TV Photojournalist Adam Copus.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CVazBWGgg64/hqdefault.jpg,2020-11-02 18:58:02.813649,Right,0.0,['None'],Neutral,False,4,VFns39RXPrU,3,Kirstie Alley

We often see our smartphones as our secure digital havens. We use them to keep our most personal information: from pictures to credit card details. Some people even save their passwords in Notes. That’s a bit too much, right? You probably have all your text and email communication, including work stuff, based or synchronized on your phone. 

To reduce the potential risks, we figured out three things: the ways your phone can be hacked, how to recognize them, and how to protect your phone from hackers.

TIMESTAMPS
You find new apps on your phone (you didn't install them) 3:45
Some apps stop working like they used to 4:20
Your phone has suddenly started to run out of juice very quickly. 4:37
Your smartphone seems slower than it used to be. 5:01
Your phone gets warm. 5:31
Your phone reboots itself, switches off, dials numbers, or starts applications. 5:56
Unknown phone numbers appear in your ""Recent calls,"" and it costs you. 6:20
You cannot switch off your device 6:47
There are noises or echo during calls 7:12
You notice an increased use of mobile data 7:28
""Pop-ups"" start appearing on your device out of nowhere 8:49
Emails sent from your phone are blocked by spam filters 9:15
You can’t make calls, or they are being dropped 9:38

SUMMARY
What should you if you see any of these signs on your phone?
Try running mobile anti-malware software, delete all the apps you have not installed, and unreliable apps eating too much traffic. If it is possible, you can also reset your phone and go back to original settings. If that does not seem enough to you, consult a professional.

How can anyone steal your personal data? 
- The easiest way is by taking possession of your phone for a few minutes and installing spy apps such as Spy Phone App, Spyzie, or Spyera. These apps are basically mobile trackers that record the incoming and outgoing phone calls and text messages. They can track GPS location, online activity and communication going on Whatsapp, Facebook, Viber, and Skype. 
- Via an unprotected Wi-Fi network in a cafe or airport. The means of public Wi-Fi, you share all your traffic with everyone around you. Think of it next time you want to “Check in” somewhere exotic. 
- When charging your phone via an unknown USB (even in an airplane or a car), there is a risk that all your data will be revealed and transferred. That’s a lot of information that can be used against you. 
- SMS phishing. This happens when you receive a message with a link saying that it is, for example, your bank statement, a money transfer, or your photos. So you click it, download the file, and then reveal all your phone contents to hackers.
- With the help of the Signalling System SS7, used by the majority of telephone stations all over the world, hackers can read your text messages, listen to your phone calls, and track your cell phone locations. But if you are not a celebrity, there is nothing to worry about.
