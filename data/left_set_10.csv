Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/At4IYzqYiHM/hqdefault.jpg,2020-11-17 15:01:57.557350,Left,0.0,['None'],Neutral,False,3,c2rvE4dtYh4,1,Jack Dorsey

Well, it's true! You can order all sorts of special items from the fast-food chain if you happen to know what's available. Without further ado, here are the secret Sonic Drive-In menu items you'll wish you'd known about sooner.

Fact: You'll find pickles on more than a few fast-food burgers, and no wonder. There's just something about a pickle's salty smack that gets us right where we live. You gotta admit this classic combo creates an unmistakable taste that's hard to resist. Well, plenty of the cheeseburgers at Sonic are packed with crinkle-cut pickles, but if you want to kick it up a notch,  you should really get your greasy little paws on some of the chain's Pickle-O's. But please note: If you want a Pickle-O's burger, there's gonna be some assembly required.

Back in the sixties, Pickle-O's were widely available at Sonic Drive-In, and they've occasionally popped up on the regular menu in more recent years. According to Secret Menus Guru, you can order Pickle-O's anytime: Sonic has plenty of pickles on hand, along with a deep fryer and lots of batter. Start spreading the news..

So what does that mean for an insatiable pickle-hound like you? Well, employees will reportedly be thrilled to fry up a batch of crisp golden PIckle-O's if you ask nicely. Then you can go bananas and shove them into your favorite Sonic burger. Oh, and here's a little friendly advice: It's better to order these bad boys when your local Sonic isn't too busy. It takes time to make PIckle-O's, so employees will be more likely to oblige your request if they aren't feeling frazzled.

Keep watching to see The Secret Sonic Drive-In Menu You'll Wish You Knew About Sooner.

At4IYzqYiHM,The Late Late Show with James Corden,UCJ0uqCI0Vqr2Rrt1HseGirg,1605108733.0,The Trumps Are Throwing a Tantrum,"After Reggie Watts catches James Corden up on the big Apple processing chip update and everyone wishes Tim Young, the band's guitarist, a happy 50th birthday, James recaps the big news of the day, including President Donald Trump, his cabinet wife, and children all refusing to accept the result of the election. And Mike Pence, head of the COVID-19 task force, is heading on vacation. And a debate breaks out about the pronunciation of ""puma"" which takes a drastic turn towards a conversation about pubic hair.

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/At4IYzqYiHM/hqdefault.jpg,2020-11-17 15:02:34.188370,Left,0.0,['None'],Neutral,False,3,c2rvE4dtYh4,4,Gavin Newsom
