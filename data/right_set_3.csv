17,_zhWHsfEa0U,Sky News Australia,UCO0akufu9MOzyz3nvGIXAAw,1603033305.0,EXCLUSIVE: Joe Biden's son emailed shop owner about hard drive to 'get it back': Former Trump chief,"Steve Bannon, former chief strategist to President Donald Trump, has revealed Joe Biden's son emailed a shop owner who had his hard drive in an effort to get it back.

The revelations come as the New York Post this week released an expose detailing links between Joe Biden and his son who was paid at least $50,000 a month to sit on the board of a Ukrainian energy company who allegedly set up a meeting with the then-Vice President.

Information regarding Hunter Biden’s relationship with the Ukranian energy company was sourced from a collection of emails recovered from a laptop that was allegedly dropped off at a repair shop in 2019 and later given to the FBI.

It was a water-damaged MacBook Pro and the person who dropped it off never paid for the service and didn't retrieve it or a hard drive on which its contents were stored - according to the shop owner who said he repeatedly tried to contact the customer.
 
Sky News host Sharri Markson said the owner of the repair shop in Biden's home state of Delaware says when he did not hear back from the FBI, he made a copy of the hard drive and gave it to Donald Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
 

Emails on the laptop revealed that Hunter Biden had planned to introduce his father – the then-Vice President – to an executive at Ukrainian energy company Burisma, a company where Hunter served on the board of directors.

Publicly, Biden has said he's never spoken to his son about his overseas business dealings. These emails seem to indicate otherwise.
 
In one message sent by Vadym Pozharsky in April 2015, he wrote: ""Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent (sic) some time together. It's realty (sic) an honour and pleasure.""

In response to this news, Facebook and Twitter both censored the article from the New York Post, advising they were ""limiting the distribution"" of the story on their platforms until a third-party contractor can ""fact check"" the article.

Mr Bannon told Ms Markson, “Hunter Biden’s lawyer has come to us both with phone calls and with emails saying, ‘hey, I’ve got to get the hard drive back’.”

“This is not some Russian intelligence operation; they admit it’s their hard drive,” Mr Bannon said.

“We have the emails from the Lawyer, if we need to release them, we’ll release them.”",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_zhWHsfEa0U/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-22 13:15:19.087916,1.3333333333333333,"['PartisanRight', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanRight']",Right,False,1,WAVp57zf5to

The English longbow is laden with myth; of its origins, its power, its achievements.  The centuries that have passed since it was used in earnest, means that the knowledge of what the bow was actually capable of doing, has also passed.  The captains and commanders that once knew its’ true power in physical and in military terms, are long dead. The knowledge is lost and it is time to rediscover what it can and cannot do.

20,_zhWHsfEa0U,Sky News Australia,UCO0akufu9MOzyz3nvGIXAAw,1603033305.0,EXCLUSIVE: Joe Biden's son emailed shop owner about hard drive to 'get it back': Former Trump chief,"Steve Bannon, former chief strategist to President Donald Trump, has revealed Joe Biden's son emailed a shop owner who had his hard drive in an effort to get it back.

The revelations come as the New York Post this week released an expose detailing links between Joe Biden and his son who was paid at least $50,000 a month to sit on the board of a Ukrainian energy company who allegedly set up a meeting with the then-Vice President.

Information regarding Hunter Biden’s relationship with the Ukranian energy company was sourced from a collection of emails recovered from a laptop that was allegedly dropped off at a repair shop in 2019 and later given to the FBI.

It was a water-damaged MacBook Pro and the person who dropped it off never paid for the service and didn't retrieve it or a hard drive on which its contents were stored - according to the shop owner who said he repeatedly tried to contact the customer.
 
Sky News host Sharri Markson said the owner of the repair shop in Biden's home state of Delaware says when he did not hear back from the FBI, he made a copy of the hard drive and gave it to Donald Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
 

Emails on the laptop revealed that Hunter Biden had planned to introduce his father – the then-Vice President – to an executive at Ukrainian energy company Burisma, a company where Hunter served on the board of directors.

Publicly, Biden has said he's never spoken to his son about his overseas business dealings. These emails seem to indicate otherwise.
 
In one message sent by Vadym Pozharsky in April 2015, he wrote: ""Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent (sic) some time together. It's realty (sic) an honour and pleasure.""

In response to this news, Facebook and Twitter both censored the article from the New York Post, advising they were ""limiting the distribution"" of the story on their platforms until a third-party contractor can ""fact check"" the article.

Mr Bannon told Ms Markson, “Hunter Biden’s lawyer has come to us both with phone calls and with emails saying, ‘hey, I’ve got to get the hard drive back’.”

“This is not some Russian intelligence operation; they admit it’s their hard drive,” Mr Bannon said.

“We have the emails from the Lawyer, if we need to release them, we’ll release them.”",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_zhWHsfEa0U/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-22 13:15:19.593175,1.3333333333333333,"['PartisanRight', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanRight']",Right,False,2,woGyMvqLV5o

This is the story of the birth of modern chess - when the possibilities of chess as an art, a science and a sport all converged.
The point of convergence was a young boy from Louisiana named Paul Morphy. At a time when America was seen as a backwoods nation with little cultural history and even less intellectual impetus, at a time when chess was considered the exclusive property of a few European countries, at a time when the game was played successfully by a handful of men wizened by years,  Paul Morphy, in the brief span of 19 months and with seemingly little effort, defeated conclusively every player he met.
While today few non chess players even know his name,  he was one of the most famous celebrities of his time and within the hallowed halls of the chess playing community he is considered by some as the greatest chess player of all time.
But this diminutive, unassuming boy rose to fame almost out of nowhere and once he secured his place in history, he retired back into that hazy unknown, shunning the public eye, never again to play serious chess. Not only was he one of great practitioners of the game, but also one of it's greatest enigmas. He's been given the sobriquet,  The Pride and Sorrow of Chess.

46,cID_bw-cH7I,Sky News Australia,UCO0akufu9MOzyz3nvGIXAAw,1603398076.0,Biden needs 'elixir of life' to get through next debate,"Sky News contributor Cory Bernardi says the Democrats wheeled Barack Obama out to campaign while Joe Biden was “getting the elixir of life to get through the debate” and animate him for long enough. 

His comment comes after former United States President Barack Obama slammed the Trump administration for its coronavirus response in a drive-in Biden campaign rally in Pennsylvania.

“Barack Obama is one of the greatest phonies,” Mr Bernardi said. 

“His rhetoric there about ‘we wouldn’t tolerate it from a president’ comes from a president who put the IRS onto conservative organizations who were opposed to his rule, that corrupted - I use that term advisedly, - the FBI and turned it against its own citizens.

“He knew about Hilary Clinton’s private server; he was communicating with her using an alias and yet he denied any of this. 

“This bloke is a phony, but that’s how desperate the Democrats are.”",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cID_bw-cH7I/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-22 13:15:20.197948,1.3333333333333333,"['PartisanRight', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanRight']",Right,False,4,63ncajChlKE

Read more from NBC News here: https://nbcnews.to/32nLdWg

Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi on Tuesday night repeated the president’s baseless claim that Democratic nominee Joe Biden wielded his influence as vice president to benefit his son Hunter’s private-sector work in Ukraine.

Bondi, who was part of Trump's impeachment defense team during his Senate trial, said Biden used U.S. foreign aid to engineer the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor, suggesting that the reason Biden pushed for the prosecutor's removal was because he was investigating Burisma Holdings, an energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board.

The event is Obama's first stump speech for his former vice president, a welcome sight to Democrats who see the former president as Joe Biden's most potent character witness and a key factor in encouraging Black men, Latinos and younger voters to turn out and vote.
Obama's speech represented his most direct attacks on Trump to date, with the former Democratic leader leveling both substantive critiques -- like questioning Trump's tax policy and handling of the coronavirus pandemic -- and personal barbs, jabbing at shrinking ratings for the President's speeches and town halls.
The remarks drilled down on years of Democratic concerns about the President, with Obama arguing Trump's presidency has not only changed the way other countries view the United States but remade the way Americans feel about politics.

78,NDx8MZjgx7o,MUSICOM PRODUCTIONS,UClwglLlOyooHDgZL4F2x3qQ,1603410070.0,TRUMP walks out 60 MINUTES' Lesley Stahl CBS Interview - COMPLETE LEAKED INTERVIEW Behind-the-Scenes,"Donald Trump released this footage apparently taken by one of his WH.gov team (so this is public domain, YouTube!). The only hot seat Donnie can handle is his Toto ass-washer douching toilet seat set to 'warm'. 'Ol Donald has the cleanest taint for sure, but the cruelest mind - and being, as Rex said, a ""MORON"".

This is NOT CBS' footage. Just a camcorder recording the room - both are off-mike, so this recording has nothing to do with the production, but all to do with the collection of propaganda elements for his failing campaign.

How the hell do you vote for a failure of an old man who: (1) Lies to you (21,000 and counting). (2) Kills his own American people with his intentional failure and ignorance to the COVID-19 health crisis tearing through the USA and destroying our way of life. (3) Allows the kidnapping and caging of minor children and orphans them from their parents, not keeping records of their whereabouts. (4) Creates division amongst Americans by playing head-games with everybody.... - the list goes on. 

Just stop the insanity (sorry, Susan Powter), and let's get this WELFARE QUEEN and HIS COURT (that's you, Ivanka) out of our daily lives - PLEASE!!!!!! 

And MAGA folk, time to throw out the bacteria-ridden Kool-Aid sitting on your counter and come back to reality with a fresh glass of Spring Water  - your leader is conning you, because he is a CON-MAN. If you're from NY area (I am), YOU KNOW THIS ALREADY.....T

HE REST OF YOU, well...COME ON, MAN! 

Unless YOU ENJOY SUPPORTING IVANKA and DON, JR. and ERIC and their TRIPS and CORRUPTION, then ""U REALLY DON'T CARE, DO U?"" - Melania.

There IS no other choice than to Vote American! Biden/Harris 2020. Or vote for Mother Russia and Putin's Puppet. You didn't like not being able to get toilet paper last March, did you?

As for Lesley Stahl, she is performing her JOB. There's a reason Lesley is considered a fair and respected journalist - she is looking for answers to accountability, responsibility, job performance, while being informative contextually - and it couldn't be more obvious in this unedited interview.

I am allowed my independent right to inform the public to make their own conclusions to who they want to vote for. My only question is how can you possibly vote for this mess? 

Now go watch my other funny videos. This one sucks.

PS Leave me alone. I could care less about your bullsh!t. I'm born in America, not 'Trump Country'...",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NDx8MZjgx7o/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-22 13:15:31.258893,0.0,['None'],Neutral,False,2,WrO6Mcm_R8o

This is the story of the birth of modern chess - when the possibilities of chess as an art, a science and a sport all converged.
The point of convergence was a young boy from Louisiana named Paul Morphy. At a time when America was seen as a backwoods nation with little cultural history and even less intellectual impetus, at a time when chess was considered the exclusive property of a few European countries, at a time when the game was played successfully by a handful of men wizened by years,  Paul Morphy, in the brief span of 19 months and with seemingly little effort, defeated conclusively every player he met.
While today few non chess players even know his name,  he was one of the most famous celebrities of his time and within the hallowed halls of the chess playing community he is considered by some as the greatest chess player of all time.
But this diminutive, unassuming boy rose to fame almost out of nowhere and once he secured his place in history, he retired back into that hazy unknown, shunning the public eye, never again to play serious chess. Not only was he one of great practitioners of the game, but also one of it's greatest enigmas. He's been given the sobriquet,  The Pride and Sorrow of Chess.

But while most of the Trumps are making headlines, one family member has managed to skirt the spotlight. 14-year-old Barron Trump is the only son of President Trump and the First Lady - and here's what America's First Kid is all about!

Barron Trump is one of five children, from Donald's three marriages. Barron's older brothers, Donald Jr. and Eric, are the children of Donald and his first wife, Ivana. Also from the first marriage is Ivanka, who works as an official assistant to the President, while her husband, Jared Kushner, is a senior adviser. 

Barron's two older brothers often appear in the spotlight due to their leading roles in The Trump Organization. And all three of the older kids made appearances during their father's campaign, speaking at both the 2016 and the 2020 Republican National Conventions. The siblings were also joined by their younger sister, Tiffany, from Donald's second marriage to Marla Maples, who spoke in support of her father, as well.

While Barron may have been absent from the official podium, we're certain he would have been speaking, too, if he were just a little older. And, it's not like he isn't familiar with being on TV… Keep watching to learn The Truth About Donald And Melania Trump's Only Son!

The thought-provoking special explores the rise of ‘cancel culture’ and the impact it is having on people’s lives and livelihoods.

Rowan speaks to academics authors, entertainers and political commentators including Warren Mundine, Jacinta Price, Laurence Fox, Lauren Southern, Peter Ridd and Douglas Murray during his investigation.

Author Douglas Murray says in the fight against cancel culture, mainstream majority views can’t be silenced so people feel they can voice them other than at the ballot box where they give the “wokerati a nasty surprise”.

Cancel culture is not justice it is a “lynch mob” which doesn’t adhere to the standards of innocent until proven guilty, according to political activist Lauren Southern.

Rob discusses the differences between the perceptions of racism in America on social media and in the real world. He worries that the exaggerating of racism by liberals is increasing political polarization. Rob discusses the constant infusion of race by the mainstream media into topics that have nothing to do with race like the story of Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the St. Louis couple who defended their home when Black Lives Matter protesters came onto their private property. Rob shares how he went to college to be a journalist and is able to see the way the media twists facts to suit their narrative. Rob talks about how more people are identifying as a gay conservative or a black conservative. He talks about the new conservative’s perception of conflict with religious conservatives like Ben Shapiro on these issues. Rob discusses the controlling nature of what he calls the “LGBTQ Cult” and how they demand complete submission to their ideology and have a lack of tolerance for any view that strays from their dogma. Rob also discusses some of the core beliefs of Black Lives Matter and why those beliefs are in conflict with most black people. Rob shares why he thinks Democrats are starting to be terrified that black voters are no longer falling for their claims of rampant racism. He cites the success of people like Candace Owens, Brandon Tatum as well as the Blexit and walkaway movement as proof that there is demand for another perspective than the one the DNC offers. Rob also shares how coming out as conservative cost him far more friends than his coming out as gay.

He also expresses his concerns about the crisis in policing, the decline of proactive policing and the lowering of standards to join law enforcement. He also talks about why he is a black conservative, how he think there are far more black conservatives than people realize, why he co-founded Blexit, his role models of black business and entrepreneurship, as well as why he thinks reparations for slavery will not help the black community.

Hillsdale College is an independent institution of higher learning founded in 1844 by men and women “grateful to God for the inestimable blessings” resulting from civil and religious liberty and “believing that the diffusion of learning is essential to the perpetuity of these blessings.” It pursues the stated object of the founders: “to furnish all persons who wish, irrespective of nation, color, or sex, a literary, scientific, [and] theological education” outstanding among American colleges “and to combine with this such moral and social instruction as will best develop the minds and improve the hearts of its pupils.” As a nonsectarian Christian institution, Hillsdale College maintains “by precept and example” the immemorial teachings and practices of the Christian faith.

The College also considers itself a trustee of our Western philosophical and theological inheritance tracing to Athens and Jerusalem, a heritage finding its clearest expression in the American experiment of self-government under law.

By training the young in the liberal arts, Hillsdale College prepares students to become leaders worthy of that legacy. By encouraging the scholarship of its faculty, it contributes to the preservation of that legacy for future generations. By publicly defending that legacy, it enlists the aid of other friends of free civilization and thus secures the conditions of its own survival and independence.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k6L5C0uLFjE/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-22 13:15:42.982912,2.0,['PartisanRight'],Far Right,False,2,mYhDnOHg1m0

Bradley Thompson | ACADEMIA | Rubin Report,"Dave Rubin of The Rubin Report talks to C. Bradley Thompson (Professor, Clemson University) about the origins of the Declaration of Independence, myths about American slavery and the founding fathers, why 1765 was possibly a more important year than 1776 for the American Revolution and why Donald Trump is one of the few presidents to ever challenge the deep state. C. Bradley debunks some of the myths about slavery in America at the time of the founding fathers. He talks about the founding fathers beliefs in universal truths, human rights and equality. He discusses the complexities of the founders regarding their different and changing views on slavery and why it is far more complicated than 1619 project from the New York Times would have you believe. Some founders like John Adams were never slave owners, others like Benjamin Franklin formally owned slaves and still others like Thomas Jefferson owned slaves and did not free them upon their death. C. Bradley digs deep into the founders conflicting actions and beliefs about the abolition of slavery and why it is far more complex then we have been led to believe. C. Bradley talks about the philosophical origins of the Declaration of Independence. He believes the year 1765 was far more important than 1776 because this was the year that the American mind was born. He tells the story of why Americans suddenly made liberty, freedom and natural rights their priorities that would eventually be enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and fought for during the Revolutionary War. C. Bradley shares one of Donald Trump’s unique accomplishments, taking on the deep state. He feels that Donald Trump is the first president in 70 years to wage war against the deep state in it’s entrenched political class, but also in the mainstream media. He also discusses if Donald Trump is in fact a moral person and if morality and virtue are personality traits we should expect in a president.

He talks about his origins on the big progressive show The Young Turks and his political awakening involving David Webb. Dave discusses how the current far left and progressive side of the Democratic party’s obsession with identity politics, diversity and being “woke” is forcing people with center-left or centrist political leanings to rethink voting for Democratic candidates in the 2020 election and rethink their party affiliation altogether.

Is the state of US news driving you crazy? Does the coverage of political news rarely seem “fair and balanced”? Serious discussions on US politics is vital to having a healthy democracy. No matter what political party you belong to, we need to be able to hear a variety of political perspectives.

Dr. Scott Atlas is the Robert Wesson Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, an accomplished physician, and a scholar of public health. When this was recorded Dr. Atlas has been making the case in print and in other media that we as a society have overreacted in imposing draconian restrictions on movement, gatherings, schools, sports, and other activities. He believes the virus is a real threat and should be managed as such. But, as Dr. Atlas argues, there are some age groups and activities that are subject to very low risk. The one-size-fits-all approach is overly authoritarian, inefficient, and not based in science. Dr. Atlas’s prescription includes more protection for people in nursing homes, two weeks of strict self-isolation for those with mild symptoms, and most importantly, the opening of all K–12 schools. Dr. Atlas was also adamant that an economic shutdown, and all of the attendant issues that go along with it, is a terrible solution— a cure that's worse than the disease. Finally, Dr. Atlas revealed some steps he’d taken in his own life to try to get things back to normal. 

NOTE TO VIEWERS: 
On September 11th, 2020 YouTube removed this episode of Uncommon Knowledge with Peter Robinson with Dr. Scott Atlas and notified The Hoover Institution that the video “violates our guidelines."" The takedown notice further explained that “YouTube does not allow content that spreads medical misinformation that contradicts the World Health Organization (WHO) or local health authorities’ medical information about COVID-19, including on methods to prevent, treat, or diagnose COVID-19 and means of transmission of COVID-19.” 
 
In order to reinstate the interview on their platform, YouTube required the Hoover Institution to add the following disclaimer to two portions of the interview: ""Prevailing medical consensus suggests that children can transmit the disease, but at a lower rate than adults."" While we disagree with YouTube’s interpretation of what Dr. Atlas said in this video, we have complied with this request to make the video available to viewers.

135,bi2hqL5KkHc,Hoover Institution,UCzWwWbbKHg4aodl0S35R6XA,1552541373.0,Jason Riley On “False Black Power?”,"Recorded on February 21, 2019. 

What is “false black power?” According to Jason Riley, author of False Black Power?, it is political clout, whereas true black power is human capital and culture. Riley and Peter Robinson dive into the arguments in Riley’s new book, the history of African Americans in the United States, and welfare inequality in black communities.  

Riley discusses the Moynihan report of 1965, which documented the rise of black families headed by single women in inner cities and how this report was something black sociologists had already been writing about for several years. He argues that there was clearly a breakdown of the nuclear family and that this is a result of the “Great Society” welfare programs of the 1960s rather than the legacy of slavery or Jim Crow laws. 

In the 1960s, Riley posits that the black activist community’s shift towards political engagement was misguided. He argues that the idea of black political clout leading to black economic advancement was misplaced. Other impoverished communities (i.e. Irish, Jewish, and Italian immigrant communities) at various times in American history focused on economic advancement first before trying to achieve political clout, and they were successful. Instead, the black community focused first on electing black politicians, which ended up doing very little for the economic advancement of the community as politicians typically put their own interests first, above their communities’. Riley points out that the economic data shows that black communities became more impoverished under black leadership. 

Riley proposes a solution of advocating for more school-choice vouchers, which allow black parents to take better control of their children’s futures and place them in the best schools for them. He also argues for reducing social safety nets, making them a more temporary form of welfare rather than the multigenerational welfare system currently in place.

Hoover Institution

The Hoover Institution presents an online virtual speaker series based on the scholarly research and commentary written by Hoover fellows participating in the Human Prosperity Project on Socialism and Free-Market Capitalism. This project objectively investigates the historical record to assess the consequences for human welfare, individual liberty, and interactions between nations of various economic systems ranging from pure socialism to free-market capitalism. Each session will include thoughtful and informed analysis from our top scholars.

FEATURING
Niall Ferguson, MA, D.Phil., is the Milbank Family Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, and a senior fellow of the Center for European Studies, Harvard, where he served for twelve years as the Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History. 

Victor Davis Hanson is the Martin and Illie Anderson Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution; his focus is classics and military history.

138,1ruwVc0t2c0,vpro documentary,UC9sXw4ZdPEIp6bYGvLW-_iA,1600177651.0,Jordan Peterson | Full interview | VPRO Documentary (2019),"This interview was not conducted to be a stand-alone interview, it was conducted for a Dutch documentary about male/female-dynamics in Canada. Within this documentary, we explored how an event like the Toronto van attack could happen in Canada and how Canadians are trying to heal from it. More broadly, we looked at misogyny and violence against women within Canada, and what it is about contemporary feminism that makes some men angry or lost. We also paid attention to men suffering from violence that their female partners had inflicted upon them. As prominent Canadian voices, we included both Margaret Atwood and Jordan Peterson.

Psychology professor Jordan Peterson has become a controversial figure ever since speaking out against Bill C-16 (2016), a law which adds gender expression and gender identity to the Canadian Human Rights Act. He has received both praise and criticism after the publication of his self-help book 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos (2018). His fans are thankful for the advice he’s given them to take responsibility for their lives, his critics argue that his emphasis on the danger posed by ‘postmodern neo-marxists’ is dangerous in itself. He has been accused of being anti-feminist and feeding into the alt-right. While he gained support among people who do identify with the alt-right, he himself does not. 

Peterson has become an important inspiration for various men’s groups, an influential voice. Therefore, we wanted to get clear where he stands on contemporary feminism and how he interprets the van attack, which took place in the city he lives in. Since the documentary episode only allowed for brief passages from the interview, while Peterson’s answers are extensive, we decided to provide the entire interview.

We talked to Peterson on the 4th of June 2019, in Toronto, Ontario. Since there were some breaks (for adjusting the camera and for having coffee) during the interview, it consists of multiple takes. Apart from leaving out the breaks themselves and making the transition between breaks more fluent, no further editing has been done.

Through minority recruitment and promotion, and other means, departments across the country have made earnest efforts to grapple with the claim that racism and policing are inextricable. But controversial police-citizen interactions have continued to fan the flames of a contentious debate. How have the unique racial dynamics in major cities in the U.S. been reflected in black cops’ experiences within their police departments? Is some degree of racial tension between police and the black community inevitable? Can the perspectives of black cops help break down the invisible wall between police and communities of color? A fascinating panel of black police executives and experts speaking to how history, culture, and looming racial tension shaped their experiences on the force.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/94Pxz5bgXs8/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-22 13:15:43.418296,2.0,['Libertarian'],Far Right,False,3,OL5G2Y6LMpE

Dr. Scott Atlas is the Robert Wesson Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, an accomplished physician, and a scholar of public health. When this was recorded Dr. Atlas has been making the case in print and in other media that we as a society have overreacted in imposing draconian restrictions on movement, gatherings, schools, sports, and other activities. He believes the virus is a real threat and should be managed as such. But, as Dr. Atlas argues, there are some age groups and activities that are subject to very low risk. The one-size-fits-all approach is overly authoritarian, inefficient, and not based in science. Dr. Atlas’s prescription includes more protection for people in nursing homes, two weeks of strict self-isolation for those with mild symptoms, and most importantly, the opening of all K–12 schools. Dr. Atlas was also adamant that an economic shutdown, and all of the attendant issues that go along with it, is a terrible solution— a cure that's worse than the disease. Finally, Dr. Atlas revealed some steps he’d taken in his own life to try to get things back to normal. 

NOTE TO VIEWERS: 
On September 11th, 2020 YouTube removed this episode of Uncommon Knowledge with Peter Robinson with Dr. Scott Atlas and notified The Hoover Institution that the video “violates our guidelines.""

In order to reinstate the interview on their platform, YouTube required the Hoover Institution to add the following disclaimer to two portions of the interview: ""Prevailing medical consensus suggests that children can transmit the disease, but at a lower rate than adults."" While we disagree with YouTube’s interpretation of what Dr. Atlas said in this video, we have complied with this request to make the video available to viewers.

Hillsdale College is an independent institution of higher learning founded in 1844 by men and women “grateful to God for the inestimable blessings” resulting from civil and religious liberty and “believing that the diffusion of learning is essential to the perpetuity of these blessings.” It pursues the stated object of the founders: “to furnish all persons who wish, irrespective of nation, color, or sex, a literary, scientific, [and] theological education” outstanding among American colleges “and to combine with this such moral and social instruction as will best develop the minds and improve the hearts of its pupils.” As a nonsectarian Christian institution, Hillsdale College maintains “by precept and example” the immemorial teachings and practices of the Christian faith.

The College also considers itself a trustee of our Western philosophical and theological inheritance tracing to Athens and Jerusalem, a heritage finding its clearest expression in the American experiment of self-government under law.
