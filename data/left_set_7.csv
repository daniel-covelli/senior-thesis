The Supreme Court will decide whether Electoral College voters have a constitutional right to cast ballots for candidates who didn’t win their state’s popular vote, the justices announced in an order on Friday.

The justices said they will hear two cases brought by Electoral College voters in Washington state and Colorado who refused to vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016 despite her wins in those states.

Like most states, Washington and Colorado require their electors to follow the will of their states’ voters. But those laws are now being challenged by Electoral College voters who argue that such laws are unconstitutional.

A decision in the matter is expected by the end of June, ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November. The cases are the latest in a string of high-profile disputes the top court is expected to resolve in a contentious election year.

Historically, the faithfulness of Electoral College voters has largely been a formality. In 2016, 10 out of the total 538 electors attempted to cast ballots out of line with their state’s popular vote. But attorneys on both sides of the issue urged the top court to resolve the constitutional question before a crisis emerges.

Watch more 2020 US election coverage at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

Long before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, low-wage workers in the United States were already struggling to pay their rent, and were being evicted at rates much higher than in other similar countries. In the US, one in 40 renters has been evicted ー compared to one in 89 in the UK, one in 227 in Denmark, and one in 25,000 in France. 

Since the pandemic took millions of US jobs in March and April, most workers who make more than $20 an hour have been able to keep working, or have returned to work. But low wage workers — the people most likely to be renters instead of homeowners — are also the least likely to have gotten their jobs back. Now, seven months into the pandemic, millions aren't working, and many of them are facing homelessness.

In this video we ask what other governments around the world have done to keep people in their homes, what the US has done, what it could do, and if the 2020 election could change any of it.

Watch more 2020 US election explainers at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

For 150 years, the US avoided formal alliances. It occasionally went to war -- fighting the War of 1812, the Spanish-American War, and World War I -- but did so without entangling itself in promises to other countries. Then, after World War II, it abruptly changed course, and began to build a network of alliances unlike anything that had come before.

Over the next few decades, the US used those alliances to keep countries around the world close, and to fight Soviet expansion, by making a promise that it would go to war if any of its allies were ever attacked. After the Soviet Union fell, the initial purpose of those alliances was gone, but the US recommitted to them, signaling again and again that the central promise of those relationships was still in effect. It kept doing so for the next 25 years.

Then the US elected a leader who took America’s global relationships in a new direction. President Trump was skeptical that America’s network of alliances was still beneficial to the US. He began to distance the US from those alliances, raising doubts about whether America would actually follow through on the promise at the core of them if provoked. Some allies moved closer to Russia or China, both of whom had attempted to undermine America’s alliances. 

Today, the future of those alliances is on the ballot in the US. One of the major presidential candidates in the 2020 election wants to return the US to its former status with its allies; the other finds its decades-old alliances costly and cumbersome. The world is waiting to see which vision Americans prefer.

Watch more 2020 US election explainers at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

In the middle of the 20th century, the US government made a decision that would transform American cities: It built a huge system of interstate highways, many of which went right through the downtowns of its biggest cities.

This sealed the country's fate as a car culture, and today we're seeing the results. In most cities, it's extremely difficult to get around without a car, in part due to public transit systems built to serve an outdated commute. And when our politics turn to infrastructure, the government often favors building new roads and highways instead of improving and expanding public transportation.

The result is a system that forces more Americans to drive, at the expense of those who rely on public transit. It's also the biggest contributor to our country’s carbon footprint. Fixing that over the long term will require a reimagining of American cities and towns. But there's also a way that, if we wanted to, we could improve American transit systems, and get more people riding them, in a matter of weeks.

Explaining why the customary concession speech is one of the most important safeguards for democracy, Jones exposes shocking legal loopholes that could enable a candidate to grab power even if they lose both the popular vote and the electoral college -- and shares what ordinary citizens can do if there's no peaceful transfer of power.

Watch more of our election coverage: http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

In the 2000 US presidential election, the Democratic candidate got half a million more votes than the Republican. The Democrat lost. Sixteen years later the same thing happened again. In the US, if you run for president, it does not actually matter how many people in the country vote for you. What matters instead is an arcane system for selecting America’s head of state called the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is the reason the US has something called “swing states,” and it’s the reason those places get to decide the future of the country. It’s the reason presidential candidates almost never campaign in the country’s biggest cities. And more recently, it’s also the reason that Republican candidates have been able to eke out victories in the presidential election without actually getting the most votes.

The Electoral College makes some Americans’ votes more powerful than others. In fact, that’s part of the reason we have it to begin with; in the country’s early years, the Electoral College helped give the votes of Southern Whites more weight than the votes of Northerners. The idea at its core, that certain votes simply matter more than others, is baked into the American tradition. In the 2020 election, it may decide the winner.

Watch more 2020 US election explainers at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

In the middle of the 20th century, the US government made a decision that would transform American cities: It built a huge system of interstate highways, many of which went right through the downtowns of its biggest cities.

This sealed the country's fate as a car culture, and today we're seeing the results. In most cities, it's extremely difficult to get around without a car, in part due to public transit systems built to serve an outdated commute. And when our politics turn to infrastructure, the government often favors building new roads and highways instead of improving and expanding public transportation.

The result is a system that forces more Americans to drive, at the expense of those who rely on public transit. It's also the biggest contributor to our country’s carbon footprint. Fixing that over the long term will require a reimagining of American cities and towns. But there's also a way that, if we wanted to, we could improve American transit systems, and get more people riding them, in a matter of weeks.

Watch more 2020 election explainers at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos 

The process of voting isn’t the same for all Americans. Depending on where you live, you might vote on a screen, a punchcard, or a piece of paper. You might have to show an ID to vote, or you might not. And you might have to wait a long time, or you might not.

Some of these differences don’t really matter. But some of them make voting harder. And sometimes they can keep people from voting altogether. For decades, the US had a civil rights law that made sure those differences were fair, and didn’t disproportionately keep certain people from voting: the 1965 Voting Rights Act. But in 2013, the US Supreme Court gutted that law, allowing states to pass a slew of new voting laws.

Those new laws often had the effect of making it harder for poor people and people of color to vote. And the 2020 US election will be shaped in part by those laws. But the same election will also decide the future of those laws.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

For over 200 years, Japan isolated itself from the outside world by forbidding most foreigners from entering the country. But in 1854, a US naval expedition of warships forced Japan to open its port cities, resulting in a flood of curious travelers from Europe and North America, who established businesses there. Photography became a leading industry in newly opened Japan, to satisfy a market of curious outsiders who wanted to know what the country and its people really looked like. 

Foreign photographers like Felice Beato and Baron Raimund von Stillfried established photo studios, and they employed fine artists from the Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock print industry to carefully apply watercolors to their prints. Eventually, those same apprentices dominated the market with their own photo studios. 

By the 20th century, mainly due to the advent of amateur photography, the souvenir photo industry in Japan declined. But for the last half of the 19th century, photos made — and carefully hand-colored — in Japanese photo studios were important documents for how the world came to know Japanese culture.

8yNkBic7GfI,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,1603415158.0,The technology that’s replacing the green screen,"The green screen is a Hollywood staple. Should it be?

It’s easy to complain about overreliance on special effects, but for projects that require impossible-to-film environments or have incredibly expensive shots, how do you get the flexibility of green screens without the drawbacks?

Charmaine Chan has worked on one of the possible answers. Vox's Phil Edwards spoke to her about her career and how it's at the forefront of a big technological shift. As a compositor for venerable effects house Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), she’s worked on films like The Last Jedi, assembling various digital elements into a beautiful, seamless image. Her job changed on The Mandalorian, one of the first shows to use ILM’s upgrade for the green screen: LED panels that used video game engine technology to place a realistic-looking world behind the actors.

It was a huge improvement, because green screens actually have a lot of drawbacks. Removing the green screen is never as quick as visual effects artists would hope. It also casts green light upon the set and actors. Even substitutes for a green screen, like projecting an image onto a screen behind the actor, fail to dynamically respond to camera movements the way they would in the real world.

ILM’s solution fixes a lot of those problems, and it also led to creative breakthroughs in which the old Hollywood order of a TV show or movie, in which VFX came last, was suddenly reversed. Now, artists like Charmaine are alongside actors, set designers, and other crew members during filming. That collaboration means that this technology doesn’t just eliminate a screen — it eliminates a creative barrier.

Watch the above video to see how it happens.

When we think of the iconic moments of the Civil Rights Movement in the US, we might imagine bus boycotts, lunch counter sit-ins or the March on Washington. Most of us won’t think of protests at beaches and pools. Yet these battles in the country’s waters played a crucial role in transforming America. 

The campaign in the waters of St. Augustine, Florida, became one of the most critical in the movement to desegregate the US. The photos were published around the world, but the full story has often been left out of our history textbooks. And now, the legacy of segregated public waters continues to this day.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

On August 4, 2020, a massive explosion rocked Beirut, the capital city of Lebanon. The blast occurred when sparks in a warehouse hit a stockpile of ammonium nitrate — a highly explosive material — that was stored in the city's port. It was one of the largest accidental explosions in history and it couldn't have occurred at a worse time for Lebanon. 

For the past several years, the country has been sliding into an economic depression and a political crisis. The root causes began during the country's 20-year civil war and extend to the organization of the government, in which control is divided among the country's many religious sects.

After years of corruption and negligence, Lebanon's people are now stuck picking up the pieces.

But the U.S. revoked his passport when he stopped through Russia, effectively stranding him there. Snowden has lived as an exile in Moscow ever since. He tells us his story.

pgw6FoFPhjo,DW Documentary,UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,1582661874.0,WikiLeaks – public enemy Julian Assange | DW Documentary,"The Wikileaks revelations shocked the world, and co-founder Julian Assange shot to fame. WikiLeaks exposed U.S. army war crimes, the secret emails of top international politicians and controversial secret service surveillance methods.

Assange’s relentless pursuit of total transparency has changed the face of journalism and given rise to much imitation, as well as fierce criticism. 

But it seems the spell has broken. After spending seven years in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, Julian Assange is now in a cell at Belmarsh, a maximum-security prison in London. In many ways, he is being treated as a terrorist. His health has suffered. The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture Nils Melzer has even referred to a ""murderous system” designed to make an example of Assange.

Assange took on a very powerful opponent. The U.S.A. is pressing charges for obtaining and disclosing classified information. Now, the extradition hearing is about to begin in London. If Assange is extradited from England to the U.S.A., he faces up to 175 years in jail for espionage. Experts are expecting one of the most significant trials of its kind to date. 

""WikiLeaks - Public Enemy Julian Assange” is a detailed depiction of the rise and fall of Julian Assange. The film reveals some personal glimpses into different aspects of the story: meetings with Assange’s worried father, talks with high-ranking U.S. officials, an exclusive interview with whistleblower Edward Snowden. And every time the key question re-emerges: Is Julian Assange a journalist or a spy?

4pt6hnabnkU,VICE News,UCZaT_X_mc0BI-djXOlfhqWQ,1556086541.0,People Are Hiring Private Police Squads in Detroit,"In 2013, the city of Detroit filed for bankruptcy. As a result, budget and pay cuts have since pushed police officers toward better paying opportunities outside the city, and private security companies have rushed into the city.

Now, private security is a booming industry in Detroit. The largest contractor has reported 25% year-over-year growth since the city’s bankruptcy.

VICE News spoke to Dale Brown, an ex-army paratrooper, who began teaching his own brand of self-defense in the early '90s and started his own Detroit-based security company called Threat Management Center in 2000. Brown says his 60-person VIPER force has more than 5,000 private citizens as clients along with 100 businesses. Altogether, the company brings in about two million dollars a year.

EqY3baNuImA,ABC News In-depth,UCxcrzzhQDj5zKJbXfIscCtg,1595937299.0,A House Divided: The Dis-United States of America | Foreign Correspondent,"Today parts of America feel like they’re at war again, as this powerful country battles disease and division under its polarising and unpredictable President.  
 
As the nation gears up for the presidential election, the ABC’s US Bureau Chief David Lipson takes us on a road trip through the northeast swing states to talk to ordinary people about the coming contest.  
 
Trump’s re-election looked like a certainty before the pandemic. Now, with the economy buckling under more lockdowns, COVID cases rising and civil unrest running in the streets, his grip on power looks more tenuous. 
 
As fringe groups arm themselves for conflict, will this fractured country survive the ultimate democratic stress-test? 
 
David meets Phil from the Michigan Liberty Militia who’s angry about his state’s lockdown orders describing them as ‘a stomp on our constitutional rights’. In protest, the Michigan Patriots Militia took control of the State parliament in April. Now Phil warns a Trump defeat could get ugly. 
 
‘There's a lot people out there that would not be able to handle that… there is people… that just think Trump is…like a God.” 
 
‘Bikers for Trump’ member Londa has kept her faith in Trump and is banking on him to deliver the prosperity America used to enjoy.  
 
‘He doesn’t care what anybody thinks. He’s doing what’s best for the country.’   
 
In middle-class Ohio, a professional soccer mum with six children says she’s changed her mind about Trump because he’s ‘unkind’.  
 
‘It's just not the way that I would want my kids to be treating anybody ”. 
 
In Detroit, once the engine of America’s car industry, Dave meets African American woman Desha. She watched her husband die a painful death from COVID-19 and is now urging African Americans to come out and vote on election day.    
 
“Gotta do it. Like we have to, you have to, it is so much more important, you know, now than ever before.”

By March 10, there were already over 8,500 cases. Under massive pressure to stop the pandemic from spreading in prisons, the government was forced to make another unprecedented decision – they released more than 200 Mafia members from high-security prisons.

For prosecutors and investigators, this decision walked back decades of hard work. For the mafia, it came at a perfect moment. The coronavirus has not only offered new business opportunities such as selling masks but also has sent Italy spiraling toward complete economic collapse, leaving the most vulnerable Italians with no option but to turn to the mob. 

VICE News goes to Naples, Italy to see how the mafia has used the pandemic to tighten their grip on Italy.

A group of armed pro-Trump and militia activists marched to the City Hall in Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday. They were confronted by Black Lives Matter  counter-protesters.

Rival protesters were filmed verbally confronting each other before police officers showed up prompting militia leader Dylan Stevens, known as the Angry Viking, to say his group was leaving the area.

Armed militias were present in various locations across the country during the recent protests against racism and police brutality.

In late August, two people were shot dead and several others injured in Kenosha, Wisconsin, after a civilian armed with a rifle opened fire on demonstrators.

This documentary provides unique insights on everyday life in the East Asian country, which most people associate with dictatorship, military parades and nuclear missile testing.

Perhaps no other country in the world is as mysterious as North Korea. In the West, it’s known as the last Stalinist dictatorship, the land of dictator Kim Jong Un, bombastic military parades and nuclear missile tests. And it is actually quite difficult to look beyond the political and examine the daily life of 25 million North Koreans. Are they allowed to laugh, dance and marry? What do they eat? Where do they go on holiday? These simple questions are difficult to answer given the isolation of the population from the rest of the world. The filmmakers behind Have Fun in Pyongyang visited people who have lived in the isolated mountainous nation for three generations. Over eight years, they visited North Korea forty times to attend festivals and harvest ceremonies, visit factories and listen to singing contests, in the process catching surprising, fascinating and bizarre glimpses of everyday life in North Korea. The documentary gives us an insight into North Korean life and helps us understand how the impoverished, isolated country has survived the end of the Cold War, the famine of the 1990s that cost hundreds of thousands their lives, and the never-ending diplomatic and military conflicts.

Anyone venturing behind the world’s last Iron Curtain into North Korea will experience a very different country to the one we know only through the usual images of rocket launches and mass rallies. The country is ruled by the dictator Kim Jong Un, whom the people worship - or are made to worship - as a god-like father figure. Little is known about daily life in North Korea, because all images that reach the outside world have been censored by the government. Visitors rarely see evidence of oppression, enforced conformity and starvation in the rural population. Still, journalist Luca Faccio is able to offer some interesting insights into the isolated country - although, of course, government watchdogs are on his heels everywhere he goes.

But very few of them will see ground combat. That's because the war is being fought mainly by Afghan soldiers on the ground, supported by U.S. airpower in the form of drones or F-16s.

VICE NEWS spent time with U.S. and Afghan forces as they try to beat back a Taliban resurgence that's seen the group now control or contest more territory in Afghanistan than at any time since the beginning of the war. We accompanied an Afghan-led counter-insurgency operation deep into Helmand province, where local forces fight day and night to push the Taliban back using heavy artillery and mine-clearance teams that dig out IEDs with their bare hands.

As top U.S. officials laud recent results on the battlefield, Afghan soldiers say the Taliban they’re fighting is stronger now than they’ve been in years.

7pEZcCJIKkg,VICE News,UCZaT_X_mc0BI-djXOlfhqWQ,1423792733.0,The Battle for Iraq: Shia Militias vs. the Islamic State,"Last summer, the group known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) swept from Syria into northern Iraq, routing Iraqi security forces and seizing the city of Mosul. Soon afterward, the group declared the establishment of a dubious ""caliphate"" in the area it controls and rebranded itself the Islamic State. With Iraq's army weakened and radical militants advancing on Baghdad, the country's Iran-backed Shia militias — which have their own history of sectarian abuses — fought back, halting the Islamic State's progress.

The militias have successfully combated Islamic State fighters on the ground with the assistance of air strikes from a US-led military coalition. But their growing influence within Iraq's government amid accusations that they have harmed Sunnis in areas that they control has led many to fear that the militias threaten the country's fragile sectarian and political balance.

VICE News traveled to Iraq in December to witness firsthand how Shia militias are taking the fight to the Islamic State, and to document the fallout of their controversial rise to power.

Thousands of North Koreans cross the border into China illegally every year. Living in perpetual fear of being discovered, with all odds against them, defectors still do everything they can to leave. If arrested in communist Laos, they may be sent back to North Korea to face prison camp or worse. The risks of escaping the North and heading to the South are so great that fewer than 25,000 North Koreans have ever made the journey successfully. VICE joins a South Korean pastor who has developed a modern-day underground railroad to move defectors from China to freedom and eventual citizenship in South Korea.

Segment 2: World's Most Dangerous Border

The most dangerous place in the world is Kashmir's line of control, which partially occupies the Indian state and separates India from Pakistan. Observers in both India and Pakistan believe the decades-old conflict between the two nations could potentially lead to the end of the world as we know it. VICE travels across Pakistan to the contested line of control in Kashmir, pointing out how close a nuclear apocalypse is yet again.

_TReGTYE_gc,tletter,UC3EZFfeGv5-qmlfdMurzw-w,1502158881.0,🚀 Visit to the Strange Land of North Korea (DPRK),"This is a film about a traveller in the strange land called North Korea or officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).

Tours to the DPRK are tightly scheduled and normally include a visit to the demilitarised zone, museums and statues to Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il, Pyongyang’s amusements parks, chandelier-laden metro system and showcase entertainment facilities such as the Circus and the SchoolChildren's Palace.  In addition to these, I took a flightseeing flight on a Mi-17 helicopter over the DPRK's capital city of Pyongyang. As well, as my tour was an extended one, it also went the northeast of the DPRK to the tri-country area around the Rason Special Economic Zone where the DPRK, China and Russia conjoin.

The cult of the Kims is perhaps the most extraordinary feature of the DPRK.  Images or statues of Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il are found everywhere.  These graven images are effectively worshipped.  This film shows scenes of the veneration of the Kims (Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il) that were witnessed.

The government guides control both what you can see and also what you can take photographs of.  If you take a photograph of the military, construction or something that they feel does not portray the DPRK in a positive light then they force you to delete the photograph.  On exiting the country, the border guards also reviewed photographs to see if they conformed to the aforementioned standards.  Despite these restrictions, this film contains images that accurately portray the state of the country as I saw it.

Venezuela documentary. Caracas - the most dangerous city in the world.
Today I will show how people live in a country, where you should only walk the street holding things you a ready to give away to folks with guns, who will surely find you sooner or later. Today we will visit the most terrifying districts, where 30 people shot per day is kind of O.K. 
You will find amazing and interesting facts about that country you never heard before.

“Most of the crimes happen exactly in these districts – robbery, murders, kidnapping.” 
We will also pay a visit to the rich district. “Huge golf fields. And they are not empty, unlike shelves in the shops.”

We will find out why a portion of fries in McDonald’s costs 130$. We will also visit the Venezuelan carnival. Venezuela is an amazing country, because full gas tank costs around $0,075 and a roll of toilet paper - $8,42. Recently there was an assassination attempt on Maduro, a copter flew to him as close as possible and exploded. Since then everyone with a copter is arrested.

StjIv33zJ9c,DW Documentary,UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,1582750416.0,Life in North Korea | DW Documentary,"Are people in North Korea allowed to laugh, dance and marry? This documentary provides unique insights on everyday life in the East Asian country, which most people associate with dictatorship, military parades and nuclear missile testing.

Perhaps no other country in the world is as mysterious as North Korea. In the West, it’s known as the last Stalinist dictatorship, the land of dictator Kim Jong Un, bombastic military parades and nuclear missile tests. And it is actually quite difficult to look beyond the political and examine the daily life of 25 million North Koreans. Are they allowed to laugh, dance and marry? What do they eat? Where do they go on holiday? These simple questions are difficult to answer given the isolation of the population from the rest of the world. The filmmakers behind Have Fun in Pyongyang visited people who have lived in the isolated mountainous nation for three generations. Over eight years, they visited North Korea forty times to attend festivals and harvest ceremonies, visit factories and listen to singing contests, in the process catching surprising, fascinating and bizarre glimpses of everyday life in North Korea. The documentary gives us an insight into North Korean life and helps us understand how the impoverished, isolated country has survived the end of the Cold War, the famine of the 1990s that cost hundreds of thousands their lives, and the never-ending diplomatic and military conflicts.

Anyone venturing behind the world’s last Iron Curtain into North Korea will experience a very different country to the one we know only through the usual images of rocket launches and mass rallies. The country is ruled by the dictator Kim Jong Un, whom the people worship - or are made to worship - as a god-like father figure. Little is known about daily life in North Korea, because all images that reach the outside world have been censored by the government. Visitors rarely see evidence of oppression, enforced conformity and starvation in the rural population. Still, journalist Luca Faccio is able to offer some interesting insights into the isolated country - although, of course, government watchdogs are on his heels everywhere he goes.

IDsyJCxYAoc,VICE News,UCZaT_X_mc0BI-djXOlfhqWQ,1513758943.0,We Joined The Marines Trying To Defeat The Strongest Taliban Army Yet,"President Trump's new Afghanistan strategy will see up to 4,000 additional troops deployed to fight the deadliest Taliban army to date in the now 16-year-old conflict. But very few of them will see ground combat. That's because the war is being fought mainly by Afghan soldiers on the ground, supported by U.S. airpower in the form of drones or F-16s.

VICE NEWS spent time with U.S. and Afghan forces as they try to beat back a Taliban resurgence that's seen the group now control or contest more territory in Afghanistan than at any time since the beginning of the war. We accompanied an Afghan-led counter-insurgency operation deep into Helmand province, where local forces fight day and night to push the Taliban back using heavy artillery and mine-clearance teams that dig out IEDs with their bare hands.

As top U.S. officials laud recent results on the battlefield, Afghan soldiers say the Taliban they’re fighting is stronger now than they’ve been in years.

7pEZcCJIKkg,VICE News,UCZaT_X_mc0BI-djXOlfhqWQ,1423792733.0,The Battle for Iraq: Shia Militias vs. the Islamic State,"Last summer, the group known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) swept from Syria into northern Iraq, routing Iraqi security forces and seizing the city of Mosul. Soon afterward, the group declared the establishment of a dubious ""caliphate"" in the area it controls and rebranded itself the Islamic State. With Iraq's army weakened and radical militants advancing on Baghdad, the country's Iran-backed Shia militias — which have their own history of sectarian abuses — fought back, halting the Islamic State's progress.

The militias have successfully combated Islamic State fighters on the ground with the assistance of air strikes from a US-led military coalition. But their growing influence within Iraq's government amid accusations that they have harmed Sunnis in areas that they control has led many to fear that the militias threaten the country's fragile sectarian and political balance.

VICE News traveled to Iraq in December to witness firsthand how Shia militias are taking the fight to the Islamic State, and to document the fallout of their controversial rise to power.

We would bet Trump's grades were bad, but there's only one way to find out. So we reached out to the principal of The New York Military Academy (Fred Willard) where a young Donald Trump went to school, to get some more information.
