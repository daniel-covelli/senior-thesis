In which John Green teaches you about the Gilded Age and its politics.  What, you may ask, is the Gilded Age? The term comes from a book by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner titled, ""The Gilded Age."" You may see a pattern emerging here. It started in the 1870s and continued on until the turn of the 20th century. The era is called Gilded because of the massive inequality that existed in the United States. Gilded Age politics were marked by a number of phenomenons, most of them having to do with corruption. On the local and state level, political machines wielded enormous power. John gets into details about the most famous political machine, Tammany Hall. Tammany Hall ran New York City for a long, long time, notably under Boss Tweed. Graft, kickbacks, and voter fraud were rampant, but not just at the local level. Ulysses S. Grant ran one of the most scandalous presidential administrations in U.S. history, and John will tell you about two of the best known scandals, the Credit Mobilier scandal and the Whiskey Ring. There were a few attempts at reform during this time, notably the Civil Service Act of 1883 and the Sherman Anti-trust act of 1890. John will also get into the Grange Movement of the western farmers, and the Populist Party that arose from that movement. The Populists, who threw in their lot with William Jennings Bryan, never managed to get it together and win a presidency, and they faded after 1896. Which brings us to the Progressive Era, which we'll get into next week!

Hey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode. The Gilded Age was marked by the success of the richest coupled with inequality and corruption. Repeated factory disasters, such as the triangle shirtwaist factory fire revealed the unsafe working conditions of the urban poor: https://www.commonlit.org/texts/the-triangle-shirtwaist-factory-fire

Gehl and Michael Porter join Patrick Bet-David on Valuetainment to talk about the political industry and how innovation can break partisan gridlock and save our democracy.

https://www.hbs.edu/Pages/default.aspx

About the Book: In The Politics Industry, business leader and path-breaking political innovator Katherine Gehl and world-renowned business strategist Michael Porter take a radical new approach. They ingeniously apply the tools of business analysis—and Porter's distinctive Five Forces framework—to show how the political system functions just as every other competitive industry does, and how the duopoly has led to the devastating outcomes we see today.

About Michael Porter: Michael E. Porter, Professor of Business Administration at the Harvard Business School, is the author of Competitive Strategy, the recipient of the 1979 McKinsey Foundation Award for The Best Harvard Business Review Article, and a guest columnist for the Wall Street Journal. Professor Porter developed the much praised MBA course on Industry and Competitive Analysis, lectures widely on competitive strategy, and is a strategic consultant to numerous companies in the United States and abroad.

About Kathrine Gehl: Katherine M. Gehl is a business leader, author and speaker. Katherine was president and CEO of Gehl Foods, a $250 Million high-tech food manufacturing company in Wisconsin where she led a transformational growth strategy, receiving multiple awards, before selling the company in 2015--in part to dedicate more time to political reform. Her career includes roles in the private and public sectors including at Oracle Corporation, Bernstein Investment Research and Management, Mayor Richard M. Daley's Office at the City of Chicago, and Chicago Public Schools. In 2011, Katherine was confirmed by the U.S. Senate to serve on the Board of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Today, Katherine describes herself as a political innovation activist.

Katherine graduated from the University of Notre Dame and holds an MA from Catholic University and an MBA from Kellogg.

👇 Free Class - Sign up here 👇
https://cf.bookkeepinglife.com/free-bookkeeping-business-webinar

Fear of Failing when starting a bookkeeping business is a natural thought.  But, let's look into it a bit and see if it's justified.

First, we need to realize that it's normal and a part of our survival mechanism to fear the unknown and not like to give up total control.

Second, we need to realize that in the realm of starting your own bookkeeping business, there is no failing, just different levels of success.  You will be successful on a scale, of which you have total control!

Third, whenever doing something new, or something that takes me out of my comfort zone, I try to look at ""worst case scenario"".  The absolute worst case scenario when it comes to starting your own bookkeeping business is that you will learn many things about yourself and what it takes to start your own home based business.  These are great things!  And they're worst case!

Lastly, always remember, in everything you do, your success is measured by your determination.  I give you every tool, guidance, and support to put you over the top.  You just bring the determination!

This video was recorded at The Australian National University on 10 April 2012.

Richard Dawkins FRS is the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at the University of Oxford. Born in British colonial Africa, he was educated in England, where he now lives. He did his doctorate at Oxford under the Nobel Prize winning zoologist Niko Tinbergen, then was briefly an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1967 to 1969, after which he returned to Oxford, first as a Lecturer in Zoology, then Reader, before being elected to his present professorship.

He is the author of nine books: The Selfish Gene (1976, 2nd Ed 1989), The Extended Phenotype (1982), The Blind Watchmaker (1986), River Out of Eden (1995), Climbing Mount Improbable (1996), Unweaving the Rainbow (1998), A Devil's Chaplain (2003), The Ancestor's Tale (2004) and The God Delusion (2006). The God Delusion has sold more than two million copies in English, and is being published in 30 other languages. Dawkins is now editing an anthology of scientific writing for Oxford University Press, The Oxford Book of Modern Science Writing. In 2006, to promote the values of education, science, and critical thinking skills, he established The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science (RDFRS) which is now a registered charity in both the UK and USA.

Richard Dawkins has Honorary Doctorates of Literature as well as Science, and is a Fellow of both the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Literature. He has been awarded the Silver Medal of the Zoological Society of London, the Michael Faraday Award of the Royal Society, the Nakayama Prize, the Cosmos International Prize, the Kistler Prize, the Shakespeare Prize and the Lewis Thomas Prize.

Lawrence M. Krauss is a renowned cosmologist and science populariser, and is Foundation Professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration, and director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University. Hailed by Scientific American as a rare public intellectual, he is also the author of more than three hundred scientific publications and nine books, including the international bestseller, The Physics of Star Trek, and his most recent bestseller entitled A Universe from Nothing.

He received his PhD from MIT in 1982 and then joined the Society of Fellows at Harvard, and was a professor at Yale University and Chair of the Physics Department at Case Western Reserve University before taking his present position. Internationally known for his work in theoretical physics, he is the winner of numerous international awards, and is the only physicist to have received major awards from all three US physics societies, the American Physical Society, the American Institute of Physics, and the American Association of Physics Teachers. Krauss is also a commentator and essayist for newspapers such as the New York Times, and the Wall St. Journal, and has written regular columns for New Scientist and Scientific American and appears regularly on radio and television. He is one of the few scientists to have crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, and is also active in issues of science and society. He serves as co-chair of the Board of Sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and on the Board of Directors of the Federation of American Scientists.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q0mljE9K-gY/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-23 17:36:21.969098,left,0.0,['None'],Neutral,False,4,b0BC3F0kqtw

| Ricky Gervais (2019)

In all his years interviewing so-called “funny” people, Charles Wooley has often been faced with the sad truth that many of them aren’t that humorous in real life. But not so Ricky Gervais. As Wooley discovered, along with the laughs this dangerously sharp comedian has the knack of being able to make people wince in agony or cringe with embarrassment at some of his observations. Ricky’s rule is there is no topic that can’t be joked about. It has landed him in plenty of trouble, but as he says, he couldn’t give a f***.

[OFFICIAL] Richard Dawkins & Lawrence Krauss [HD] 02-04-12,"Join critically-acclaimed author and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins and world-renowned theoretical physicist and author Lawrence Krauss as they discuss biology, cosmology, religion, and a host of other topics.  

The authors will also discuss their new books. Dawkins recently published The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True, an exploration of the magic of discovery embodied in the practice of science. Written for all age groups, the book moves forward from historical examples of supernatural explanations of natural phenomena to focus on the actual science behind how the world works.
 
Krauss's latest book, A Universe from Nothing: Why There is Something Rather than Nothing, explains the scientific advances that provide insight into how the universe formed. Krauss tackles the age-old assumption that something cannot arise from nothing by arguing that not only can something arise from nothing, but something will always arise from nothing.

Founded in 2008, the ASU Origins Project is a university-wide transdisciplinary initiative aimed at facilitating cutting edge research and inquiry about origins questions, enhancing public science literacy, and improving science education. Since its inception, the Origins Project has brought the world's leading scientists, including Nobel Prize winners, to Tempe to explore origins questions. The Origins Project has hosted workshops and public events that have focused on questions as fundamental as the origin of the universe, how life began, the origins of human uniqueness, and the origins of morality.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YUe0_4rdj0U/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-23 17:36:21.969298,left,0.0,['None'],Neutral,False,4,b0BC3F0kqtw

""...Dennis Miller is embarking on a journey of reinvention, one starting with a quick U-turn from his new standup special.

“Fake News-Real Jokes,” out Tuesday on Amazon, Google, iTunes and other streaming platforms and as an album, will be followed by a self-described “mental exercise” to see what it’s like to ease away from political humor and try something on the lighter side.

...

The simple goal is “just be funny and not talk about the issues as much,” said Miller, who turns 65 on Saturday.

...

Miller, who describes himself as “socially liberal, fiscally conservative,” mused that Hollywood might be eyeing a makeover of its own after the midterm elections....""*

France gave us the Statue of Liberty in 1886 as a symbol of the friendship between our countries, so how would Americans feel about Donald Trump sending her back?

The saddest part about the book and these impeachment proceedings, is that Trump's hardcore supporters don't want to know what he has done wrong. They will support him no matter what. So to prove it, we went out on the street, found people who are fans of Donald Trump, and we asked them how they felt about a bunch of stuff Trump has done. Except none of it was stuff Trump has done, all of the events we described were about Watergate and Richard Nixon.

""President Trump used to boast that one of the things that made “life worth living” was sleeping with his friends’ wives, according to a new tell-all book.

“In pursuing a friend’s wife, he would try to persuade the wife that her husband was perhaps not what she thought,” author Michael Wolff quotes a Trump friend as saying.

Before he was president, Trump would have his secretary ask the friend to drop by his office, where he would subject him to “more or less constant sexual banter,” according to “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” a copy of which was obtained by The Post.""*

O’Reilly opened by contending that because marijuana is a drug, all of these celebrities are actually drug dealers. Miller shot back that marijuana is legal in many states — but that didn’t stop him from also taking shots at the celebrities who have lent their names to strains.""*

Support the Majority Report's video content by going to http://www.Patreon.com/MajorityReport

In this Majority Report clip, Andy Kindler joins us to discuss how Dennis Miller likes to workshop his latest punchlines from the 1970's on Fox News.

""Celebrities and members of the Hollywood community have been harsh critics of President Trump and his policies, but comedian Dennis Miller said he has a found a way to tune out all the negativity.

“When I hear Robert De Niro begin to speak now, I turn my back to him and look over my shoulder and say, ‘You talking to me? You talking to me?’ That’s where it’s come to with Robert De Niro,” said Miller during an interview on the FOX Business Network...

Miller also commented on the wave of political correctness that seems to be engulfing college campus across the nation, and in return, limiting the voice of free speech.

“Jesus Christ could appear on a college campus right now and change water into wine, and he would be frog-walked off by the campus cops because he killed some microorganisms in the wine.”""*

""...Dennis Miller is embarking on a journey of reinvention, one starting with a quick U-turn from his new standup special.

“Fake News-Real Jokes,” out Tuesday on Amazon, Google, iTunes and other streaming platforms and as an album, will be followed by a self-described “mental exercise” to see what it’s like to ease away from political humor and try something on the lighter side.

...

The simple goal is “just be funny and not talk about the issues as much,” said Miller, who turns 65 on Saturday.

...

Miller, who describes himself as “socially liberal, fiscally conservative,” mused that Hollywood might be eyeing a makeover of its own after the midterm elections....""*

""His material has become increasingly tainted by reactionary intolerance, as indicated by early tremors such as his disdain for the American Civil Liberties Union. And so I thought it was courageous of him to perform before an audience of 1500 at Davies Symphony Hall in ultra-progressive San Francisco last November. Miller himself was shocked that anybody had shown up, and said so on stage: ""I thought I was persona non grata in San Francisco.""

His material that night ranged from a defense of Operation Iraqi Freedom (poking fun at what he described as ""the left's fixation on the administration's failure to rally international support""), to an allusion that something was ""harder to get off than Martha Stewart on a set of dirty sheets,"" to ""recasting the film title Fitzcarraldo as a verb in an old routine about post office inertia.""

So many comedians rely on easy joke references that will be recognized by the largest common denominator. Since there's nothing intrinsically funny about them, instead of laughing the audience applauds; they're really applauding themselves for recognizing the reference.

Support the Majority Report's video content by going to http://www.Patreon.com/MajorityReport

In this Majority Report clip, Andy Kindler joins us to discuss how Dennis Miller likes to workshop his latest punchlines from the 1970's on Fox News.

""Celebrities and members of the Hollywood community have been harsh critics of President Trump and his policies, but comedian Dennis Miller said he has a found a way to tune out all the negativity.

“When I hear Robert De Niro begin to speak now, I turn my back to him and look over my shoulder and say, ‘You talking to me? You talking to me?’ That’s where it’s come to with Robert De Niro,” said Miller during an interview on the FOX Business Network...

Miller also commented on the wave of political correctness that seems to be engulfing college campus across the nation, and in return, limiting the voice of free speech.

“Jesus Christ could appear on a college campus right now and change water into wine, and he would be frog-walked off by the campus cops because he killed some microorganisms in the wine.”""*

KNNLt38HE64,60 Minutes Australia,UC0L1suV8pVgO4pCAIBNGx5w,1600616369.0,EXCLUSIVE: Melania Trump's former friend reveals White House secrets | 60 Minutes Australia,"Subscribe here: http://9Soci.al/chmP50wA97J Full Episodes: https://9now.app.link/uNP4qBkmN6 | Lady and the Trumps (2020)

Just as the world has never experienced a United States President quite like Donald Trump, it’s not seen a First Lady like Melania Trump either. Despite being one of the most photographed women on the planet, she remains virtually unknown. But wealthy New York socialite Stephanie Winston Wolkoff is now controversially trying to change all that. She says she was “besties”” with Melania for 15 years, and because of their friendship was not only appointed a senior adviser to the First Lady, she was also asked to organise Trump’s presidential inauguration. But two years ago the friendship between the two women soured. Stephanie claims she was the victim of an orchestrated political hit and was bitterly disappointed when Melania abandoned her. Many are calling it a despicable act of revenge, but Stephanie has now written a tell-all book about the First Lady and her secrets, and as she explains to Liam Bartlett in an exclusive interview, there are plenty of secrets to tell about Melania and the Donald.

The President of the United States is often referred to as the most powerful man in the world. But Donald Trump’s niece, Mary Trump says the current POTUS is really the most dangerous man in the world. She is so troubled by Trump’s abuse of his position that she says it’s her patriotic duty to take him down. And to do that she has written a brutal tell-all memoir. As Liam Bartlett discovers in an Australian television exclusive interview, the book is the ultimate insider’s account of a truly dysfunctional family. But it has added substance because Doctor Mary Trump is also a clinical psychologist. Her analysis of how her Uncle Don became Uncle Sam is not just a page-turner, it’s a horror story.

guoiy0bZbT8,60 Minutes Australia,UC0L1suV8pVgO4pCAIBNGx5w,1595772444.0,EXCLUSIVE: Mary Trump's insider interview on 'most dangerous' President | 60 Minutes Australia,"Subscribe here: http://9Soci.al/chmP50wA97J Full Episodes: https://9now.app.link/uNP4qBkmN6 | Uncle Don/Sam (2020) 

The President of the United States is often referred to as the most powerful man in the world. But Donald Trump’s niece, Mary Trump says the current POTUS is really the most dangerous man in the world. She is so troubled by Trump’s abuse of his position that she says it’s her patriotic duty to take him down. And to do that she has written a brutal tell-all memoir. As Liam Bartlett discovers in an Australian television exclusive interview, the book is the ultimate insider’s account of a truly dysfunctional family. But it has added substance because Doctor Mary Trump is also a clinical psychologist. Her analysis of how her Uncle Don became Uncle Sam is not just a page-turner, it’s a horror story.

35aT9ikWcqc,The Young Turks,UC1yBKRuGpC1tSM73A0ZjYjQ,1493105651.0,Think Trump's Stupid? Get A Load Of This Interview...,"Trump’s recent AP interview was… wow. Cenk Uygur, host of The Young Turks, breaks it down. Tell us what you think in the comment section below. http://tytnetwork.com/go

""President Donald Trump lied about his policy accomplishments, interrupted himself, and went off on a series of incoherent rants during a recent interview with The Associated Press’ Julie Pace.

The AP released part of the interview last week, but made a fuller transcript available late Sunday. You can read it in full here, but beware: It’s a doozy. The phrase “Donald Trump is unintelligible” was even a top trending topic on Twitter early Monday ― referring to the 16 instances where the AP marked parts of the transcript “unintelligible.” (Pace later told the Toronto Star that one of Trump’s aides was talking over him at those moments, and that the aide did not want their comments included in the transcript. The Star notes that “this is itself highly unusual.”)

Here are some of the interview’s most bizarre moments:

Shunning reality, Trump said he’s “mostly there” on fulfilling the promises of his first 100 days.

With the 100-day mark looming on April 29, the president has fallen short on every one of the legislative goals he set last year in his “100-day action plan.” Most notably, the Republican health care bill that Trump campaigned extensively for went down in flames. He has also failed to secure funding for the wall he’s hoping to build along the U.S.-Mexico border.”*

There was little Jeffrey Epstein wouldn’t do to satisfy his lust for young women and girls. It included spending millions of dollars masterminding a worldwide sex-trafficking operation. Countless innocent lives were destroyed. A year ago Epstein was arrested and a month later he died in custody. Investigators though refused to let this scandal go to the grave with him. Instead they shifted their attention to his high-profile friends. One of them is the Queen’s son, Prince Andrew, who continues to dodge requests from the FBI for an interview. But late this week there was a significant breakthrough in the case with the arrest of socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.  She’s accused of being Epstein’s right-hand woman and has been charged with multiple child sex offences. As Tara Brown reports, for the first time in a long time, the victims in this wicked saga are feeling relief rather than terror.
