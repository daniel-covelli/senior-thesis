Sky News Australia breaks down this 87-page document which examines possible conflicts of interest in foreign business while Joe Biden was vice president in Barack Obama’s administration.

The report found that the Obama administration knew Hunter Biden’s presence on the board of the corrupt Ukrainian energy company Burisma was “problematic” and “interfered” in the “execution of policy” with Ukraine.

The allegations are extraordinary – so much so that social media giants Facebook and Twitter sought to censor the story to stop it reaching voters in a manner Republicans have labelled brazen ""election interference"".",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5649FAF3_ws/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-29 10:01:37.750541,Left,1.3333333333333333,"['PartisanRight', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanRight']",Right,False,1,2mGTunEaP1A

""Miles Taylor, the former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, has revealed himself to be ""Anonymous,"" the author of a New York Times op-ed and book critical of the Trump presidency.

""To be clear, writing those works was not about eminence (they were published without attribution), not about money (I declined a hefty monetary advance and pledged to donate the bulk of the proceeds), and not about crafting a score-settling 'tell all' (my focus was on the President himself and his character, not denigrating former colleagues),"" Taylor wrote in a Medium post.

""Nevertheless, I made clear I wasn't afraid to criticize the President under my name.""

Taylor, in media interviews as recently as August, denied being ""Anonymous.""*

""A sudden drop in the stock market in recent days threatens to muddle President Trump’s campaign message about the U.S. economic recovery, just days before the Nov. 3 election.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 943 points Wednesday and is down nearly 9 percent since Sept. 2.

The sell-off began two weeks ago but intensified Monday. It has been triggered by a surge in coronavirus cases and the fact that the White House and Democrats are at an impasse over relief talks.""*

""Hundreds of President Donald Trump supporters were left in the freezing cold for hours after a rally at an airfield in Omaha, Nebraska, on Tuesday night, with some walking around three miles to waiting buses and others being taken away in ambulances.

Many of those at the rally at the Eppley Airfield faced hours in long lines to get in and clogged parking lots and busy crowds to get out, hours after his Air Force One departed around 9 p.m. Crowds cleared about 12:30 a.m.

According to dispatches from Omaha Police department, recorded by radio communications platform, Broadcastify, at least 30 people including the elderly, an electric wheelchair user and a family with small children were among those requiring medical attention after hours of waiting in the cold at the rally at the Eppley Airfield.""

""Miles Taylor, the former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, has revealed himself to be ""Anonymous,"" the author of a New York Times op-ed and book critical of the Trump presidency.

""To be clear, writing those works was not about eminence (they were published without attribution), not about money (I declined a hefty monetary advance and pledged to donate the bulk of the proceeds), and not about crafting a score-settling 'tell all' (my focus was on the President himself and his character, not denigrating former colleagues),"" Taylor wrote in a Medium post.

""Nevertheless, I made clear I wasn't afraid to criticize the President under my name.""

Taylor, in media interviews as recently as August, denied being ""Anonymous.""*

""President Donald Trump’s rally at Eppley Airfield in Omaha, Nebraska, ended around 9 p.m. Tuesday, but hundreds of attendees wouldn’t make their way out of the freezing cold until a few hours later.

As Trump jetted away on Air Force One, his supporters lined up to wait for buses to take them back to their cars, which were parked miles away from the event.

But the buses, organized by the Trump campaign, were staggeringly slow to return. There were plenty of buses, the campaign told the Omaha World-Herald, but they were stuck in traffic after the rally because the two-lane airport access road was limited to one direction.""*

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 943 points Wednesday and is down nearly 9 percent since Sept. 2.

The sell-off began two weeks ago but intensified Monday. It has been triggered by a surge in coronavirus cases and the fact that the White House and Democrats are at an impasse over relief talks.""*

""President Donald Trump repeatedly attacked Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, during his rally in Lansing, Michigan, on Tuesday, at one point taking credit for the FBI thwarting a plot to kidnap her and then immediately downplaying the actual threat that had been posed to Whitmer.

""Your governor, I don't thinks she likes me too much,"" Trump joked, prompting a loud reaction from the crowd.

""Hey, hey, hey hey,"" he told the audience, ""I'm the one, it was our people that helped her out with her problem.""*

""To be clear, writing those works was not about eminence (they were published without attribution), not about money (I declined a hefty monetary advance and pledged to donate the bulk of the proceeds), and not about crafting a score-settling 'tell all' (my focus was on the President himself and his character, not denigrating former colleagues),"" Taylor wrote in a Medium post.

""Nevertheless, I made clear I wasn't afraid to criticize the President under my name.""

Taylor, in media interviews as recently as August, denied being ""Anonymous.""*

The board's monthly meeting ended abruptly after a stream of activists, clergy and community groups demanded the board take a vote to remove Rick Smith, the police chief in Kansas City, Missouri.

But before it ended, one of those activists, Keiajah Brooks, called out Smith for using photo opportunities with Black children for PR purposes while being complicit in their ""oppression and denigration.""*

""President Donald Trump’s rally at Eppley Airfield in Omaha, Nebraska, ended around 9 p.m. Tuesday, but hundreds of attendees wouldn’t make their way out of the freezing cold until a few hours later.

As Trump jetted away on Air Force One, his supporters lined up to wait for buses to take them back to their cars, which were parked miles away from the event.

But the buses, organized by the Trump campaign, were staggeringly slow to return. There were plenty of buses, the campaign told the Omaha World-Herald, but they were stuck in traffic after the rally because the two-lane airport access road was limited to one direction.""*

In US news and current events today, Donald Trump made headlines after he walked out of his '60 Minutes' interview with Lesley Stahl after only 35 minutes. Trump then leaked the full interview himself.

The interview begins with Lesley Stahl asking Donald Trump, 'You're ok with some tough questions?' and Trump responding, 'No, I'm not.' 

Lesley Stahl repeatedly presses President Trump to share his health care plan, to explain the rise in COVID-19 cases, to justify why he called Dr. Anthony Fauci an 'idiot,' and more. At one point, Trump explicitly states that he hopes the Supreme Court 'ends' Obamacare.

The Detroit Free Press called her a ""pioneer for women in the news business,"" and she's been a mainstay on 60 Minutes since March 1991. 

CBS News also notes that she's interviewed President Donald Trump several times: She interviewed him when he was first named the Republican nominee in 2016, in his first television interview as president-elect, and in a one-on-one as his second year in office came to an end. 

With all that history, you might think Stahl and the president would have been more at ease with one another, but that was clearly not the case. Days before the latest 60 Minutes interview with the veteran journalist, President Trump was already taking to Twitter to tell fans he wasn't happy with her or with the way things had gone. 

But it turns out there was much more to talk about than just his abrupt departure. 

The interview was so contentious that the White House opted to break an existing agreement it had with CBS to embargo the video, releasing its own version of the raw footage on social media. 

Stahl then reminds the president that the last time she interviewed him, he asked her to ""bring it on"" — but it wasn't the same this time around because, as the president said, ""I'm not looking for that.""

The edited 60 Minutes interview viewers saw on Sunday night didn't exactly position Stahl the way the president might have hoped either. Instead, it showed a calm and collected correspondent who got under Trump's skin. 

On balance, though, the praise for Stahl's handling of the tense showdown seemed to outweigh the criticism. 

Keep watching to see Lesley Stahl's 60 Minutes Performance Is Causing Quite A Stir.

In US news and current events today, Donald Trump made headlines after he walked out of his '60 Minutes' interview with Lesley Stahl after only 35 minutes. Trump then leaked the full interview himself.

The interview begins with Lesley Stahl asking Donald Trump, 'You're ok with some tough questions?' and Trump responding, 'No, I'm not.' 

Lesley Stahl repeatedly presses President Trump to share his health care plan, to explain the rise in COVID-19 cases, to justify why he called Dr. Anthony Fauci an 'idiot,' and more. At one point, Trump explicitly states that he hopes the Supreme Court 'ends' Obamacare.

""The White House’s science policy office on Tuesday ranked “ending the Covid-19 pandemic” atop the list of President Donald Trump’s top first-term accomplishments, even as the country registers record amounts of infections and hospitals fill up again.

The list, included in a press release from the Office of Science and Technology Policy credits the administration for taking “decisive actions to engage scientists and health professionals in academia, industry, and government to understand, treat, and defeat the disease.”

It’s the latest inaccurate claim from the administration on the severity of the pandemic, which Trump has downplayed throughout his reelection campaign, and as Vice President Mike Pence’s office is dealing with an outbreak.

Her Republican challenger, John Cummings, has still managed to raise $9.6 million, in a sign of how desperate her critics are to beat her, The New York Times reported on Saturday.

""I guarantee you 75% of his contributors don't know anything about him,"" Tom Doherty, a Republican strategist, told the newspaper of Cummings, a former Bronx schoolteacher and police officer.

""The people that are interested in that race financially are giving because it's AOC,"" he said.""

“At least 17 women treated by a doctor alleged to have performed unnecessary or overly aggressive gynecological procedures without proper informed consent remain in detention at Irwin County Detention Center, a privately run facility in Georgia housing U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement detainees, according to a briefing and written materials submitted by attorneys and advocates to Senators in a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill. The total number of women known to have been seen by the doctor since 2018 who say they underwent or were pressured to undergo unnecessary treatments has risen to 57 — a higher number than previously known — according to the group of lawyers.

The new numbers of relevant cases and women who remain in detention were included in the materials submitted to the closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill about the ordeal over women’s medical care at Irwin. Organized by the Senate Democratic Caucus, attorney Sarah Owings of Owings MacNorlin law firm in Atlanta, two women previously detained in Irwin, and four independent doctors presented recent findings, including more than 60 pages of written materials, in a Monday briefing for the senators. The briefings came as part of Congressional investigations into the allegation, which Democratic leaders in both houses of Congress have pledged to look in to.""

""The five conservatives on the Supreme Court affirmed an appeals court ruling overturning a decision that would have extended Wisconsin’s mail-in ballot receipt deadline by six days. Absentee ballots in Wisconsin now must be received by the close of polls on Election Day.

This 5-3 ruling comes as part of a string of decisions by the conservatives on the court blocking lower court rulings that would have made it easier to vote during the coronavirus pandemic. But hidden within the main concurrence written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh are two threats much greater than overturning six extra days for ballots to arrive by mail: He explicitly endorsed legal theories that could help President Donald Trump stop the counting of mailed ballots after Election Day or, worse, override results with the help of Republican state legislatures. 

First, Kavanaugh, who was appointed by Trump, affirmed the sentiment expressed by the president that it is somehow necessary for the election to be decided on election night and that suspicion should be cast upon valid ballots counted after Nov. 3 in states that allow election officials to do so.""

With voting rights under threat across the country, Trump insists all ballots be counted by November 3rd. Chuck Todd “both sides” the pandemic. Audio obtained by CNN shows just how dumb Jared Kushner is. Tucker Carlson MISPLACES “incriminating” documents that would harm Joe Biden. New polling shows an extremely tight race between Jon Ossoff and David Perdue in Georgia. The Trump administration continues to politicize and undermine climate change efforts.

""President Donald Trump’s rally at Eppley Airfield in Omaha, Nebraska, ended around 9 p.m. Tuesday, but hundreds of attendees wouldn’t make their way out of the freezing cold until a few hours later.

As Trump jetted away on Air Force One, his supporters lined up to wait for buses to take them back to their cars, which were parked miles away from the event.

But the buses, organized by the Trump campaign, were staggeringly slow to return. There were plenty of buses, the campaign told the Omaha World-Herald, but they were stuck in traffic after the rally because the two-lane airport access road was limited to one direction.""*

""The White House’s science policy office on Tuesday ranked “ending the Covid-19 pandemic” atop the list of President Donald Trump’s top first-term accomplishments, even as the country registers record amounts of infections and hospitals fill up again.

The list, included in a press release from the Office of Science and Technology Policy credits the administration for taking “decisive actions to engage scientists and health professionals in academia, industry, and government to understand, treat, and defeat the disease.”

It’s the latest inaccurate claim from the administration on the severity of the pandemic, which Trump has downplayed throughout his reelection campaign, and as Vice President Mike Pence’s office is dealing with an outbreak. Trump, who insists the country is ""rounding the turn"" on the coronavirus, continues to hold packed campaign rallies and attacks the news media for focusing on surging infections.""

Trump tanks the stock market AGAIN. Ana Kasparian and John Iadarola discuss on The Young Turks. Keep Hope (and TYT) Alive: http://tyt.com/go

""A sudden drop in the stock market in recent days threatens to muddle President Trump’s campaign message about the U.S. economic recovery, just days before the Nov. 3 election.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 943 points Wednesday and is down nearly 9 percent since Sept. 2.

The sell-off began two weeks ago but intensified Monday. It has been triggered by a surge in coronavirus cases and the fact that the White House and Democrats are at an impasse over relief talks.""*

""An activist delivered an impassioned speech during a meeting of the Kansas City Board of Police Commissioners that has gone viral on social media.

The board's monthly meeting ended abruptly after a stream of activists, clergy and community groups demanded the board take a vote to remove Rick Smith, the police chief in Kansas City, Missouri.

But before it ended, one of those activists, Keiajah Brooks, called out Smith for using photo opportunities with Black children for PR purposes while being complicit in their ""oppression and denigration.""*

There was little Jeffrey Epstein wouldn’t do to satisfy his lust for young women and girls. It included spending millions of dollars masterminding a worldwide sex-trafficking operation. Countless innocent lives were destroyed. A year ago Epstein was arrested and a month later he died in custody. Investigators though refused to let this scandal go to the grave with him. Instead they shifted their attention to his high-profile friends. One of them is the Queen’s son, Prince Andrew, who continues to dodge requests from the FBI for an interview. But late this week there was a significant breakthrough in the case with the arrest of socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.  She’s accused of being Epstein’s right-hand woman and has been charged with multiple child sex offences. As Tara Brown reports, for the first time in a long time, the victims in this wicked saga are feeling relief rather than terror.
