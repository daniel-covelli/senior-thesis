Pres. Trump and his allies have argued for weeks that votes tallied after election night shouldn't count. 'The Election should end on November 3rd, not weeks later!' Trump tweeted. GOP officials say they may legally challenge votes not counted on Election Day. But no laws back up Trump's claims. Here are the facts:
1) Ballots are legally counted after Election Day in all 50 states
2) No state reports final results or certifies the winner on Election Day
3) In 29 states, military ballots can be received after Election Day, and in 18 states, ballots that arrive after Election Day are counted, per state law
4) Absentee & mail ballots take longer to count, with several processes done by hand; that doesn't mean late results are flawed or fraudulent
5) People voting by mail are disproportionately Democrats, so neither in-person ballots nor mail ballots reflect the full vote count

_FcyfOaXSsk,NowThis News,UCn4sPeUomNGIr26bElVdDYg,1604286037.0,"Election Tracker — November 1, 2020 | LIVE | NowThis","GET THE FACTS—TRUMP TRIES TO DELEGITIMIZE VOTE-COUNTING: NowThis is tracking the latest 2020 news & forecasts. Pres. Trump and his allies have argued for weeks that votes tallied after election night shouldn't count. 'The Election should end on November 3rd, not weeks later!' Trump tweeted. GOP officials say they may legally challenge votes not counted on Election Day. But no laws back up Trump's claims. Here are the facts:
1) Ballots are legally counted after Election Day in all 50 states
2) No state reports final results or certifies the winner on Election Day
3) In 29 states, military ballots can be received after Election Day, and in 18 states, ballots that arrive after Election Day are counted, per state law
4) Absentee & mail ballots take longer to count, with several processes done by hand; that doesn't mean late results are flawed or fraudulent
5) People voting by mail are disproportionately Democrats, so neither in-person ballots nor mail ballots reflect the full vote count

""When Sam Peterson enrolled at Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa, he found the college experience mind-boggling. So too, he says, was figuring out how to vote in the 2018 midterm elections.

""Even though I had helped out with voter registration drives, I still felt confused about how to register. I didn't know what voting by mail was or absentee voting was,"" said Peterson, who is now 21 and a fellow with the left-leaning NextGen Iowa. ""So then, I was just really overwhelmed with school and with this voting thing, and so I didn't vote in 2018.”

That year, young voters turned out in historic numbers and were part of the coalition that helped to elect a Democratic House of Representatives. And with days until Election Day, signs have emerged that young voters are poised for another cycle of record turnout, particularly as young people are more likely than their older counterparts to vote in person and later in the election season.""

""Among the most respected and revelatory of polls is the annual survey of Americans’ opinions from the Public Religion Research Institute, which released this year’s survey earlier this week. It contains few surprises, but its detailed questioning of different subgroups confirms just how starkly we’re divided—above all, on issues of race.

First, to the one question uppermost in everyone’s mind, the poll found that Americans favored Joe Biden over Donald Trump by a 56 percent to 42 percent margin, when those “leaning” to one or the other candidate were factored in.

The one attitudinal (that is, not directly candidate related)question on the poll that produced the answer most at variance with the same question’s answer on a previous (2016) poll asked respondents whether they believed that “God granted the United States a special role in human history.” Every time that question had been previously posed, most Americans answered Yes—in 2016, by a 57 percent to 40 percent margin. This year, those figures were just about reversed: 58 percent said No, while just 40 percent said Yes (64 percent of Republicans still said Yes, but only 32 percent of Democrats did).

""Utah State epidemiologist Dr. Angela Dunn responded to a new report that Utah's hospitals could soon be forced to ration care in Utah as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to strain the healthcare industry.

With new coronavirus cases shattering records on a daily basis, Utah’s hospitals are expected to begin rationing care in a week or two, The Salt Lake Tribune reports.

""This is NOT ok. It is maddening that we are planning to ration care in Utah. Unacceptable. We must do EVERYTHING we can to slow #COVID spread. No excuses,"" Dr. Dunn wrote in a tweet Monday morning.

That’s the prediction of Greg Bell, president of the Utah Hospital Association, who said administrators of the state’s hospitals confronted Gov. Gary Herbert on Thursday with a grim list: Criteria they propose doctors should use if they are forced to decide which patients can stay in overcrowded intensive care units.""

""Among the most respected and revelatory of polls is the annual survey of Americans’ opinions from the Public Religion Research Institute, which released this year’s survey earlier this week. It contains few surprises, but its detailed questioning of different subgroups confirms just how starkly we’re divided—above all, on issues of race.

First, to the one question uppermost in everyone’s mind, the poll found that Americans favored Joe Biden over Donald Trump by a 56 percent to 42 percent margin, when those “leaning” to one or the other candidate were factored in.

The one attitudinal (that is, not directly candidate related)question on the poll that produced the answer most at variance with the same question’s answer on a previous (2016) poll asked respondents whether they believed that “God granted the United States a special role in human history.” Every time that question had been previously posed, most Americans answered Yes—in 2016, by a 57 percent to 40 percent margin. This year, those figures were just about reversed: 58 percent said No, while just 40 percent said Yes (64 percent of Republicans still said Yes, but only 32 percent of Democrats did). We can only surmise that the cumulative effects of the pandemic, the natural disasters, the realization of police anti-Black violence, and the Trump presidency have made it harder for most Americans to believe we retain the favor of the Almighty.""

""Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, now personal attorney to President Donald Trump, had some tense moments on Fox Business on Tuesday and at one point threatened to walk off.
Lisa “Kennedy” Montgomery asked Giuliani about the Hunter Biden smear and conspiracy theories he’s pushed on Fox News and in the New York Post.

“Some could say you are acting like Christopher Steele,” she said, referring to the former British spy behind a salacious and unverified dossier on Trump. 

That set Giuliani off. 

“You better apologize for that!” he declared. “I’ve been a United States attorney, associate attorney general, mayor of New York City and a member of the bar for 50 years.” 

His voice rising, he called it an “outrageous defamation” to be compared to Steele.""

Rittenhouse is suspected to have shot at Black Lives Matter protesters who had been demonstrating against the shooting of Jacob Blake.

Although Donald is known for his gregarious nature and Melania is considered shy, the pair shared an undeniable chemistry from the start. This is the truth about their marriage.

Donald first laid eyes on Melania Trump in 1998 at the Kit Kat Club in New York City, after being introduced by an Italian businessman. Melania revealed on Larry King Live: 

But in an interview with The New York Post, Melania's friend Edit Molnar said that Donald was there with another woman, so Melania didn't entertain his advances.

But The Donald was smitten. The President-to-be told Tatler: 

""I'd seen her before, on the runways and things, but her beauty utterly amazed me."" 

Even though his playboy friends told him not to waste his time because they'd already tried to court her, he persisted and asked for Melania's number. Melania recalled:

""But I didn't give it to him, because I knew who he was [...] He had all these ladies, so I [wanted] to see what kind of number he [would] give to me."" 

Although she was skeptical, Donald didn't give her his business line, but his personal digits. She called him a few days later and the rest is history. Watch the video to hear more Details Revealed About Donald Trump And Melania's Marriage!

Jim believes that the election is ‘closer than you think’ and explains why the polls could be wrong like they were in 2016. Jim predicts that Trump is likely to win the US presidential election this time around too. 

This interview was released to subscribers of Rock Stock Insider and Hard Money Trader, to learn more about Shae Russell’s special investment newsletters check out the links below.

Rock Stock Insider - https://www.dailyreckoning.com.au/investment-services/rock-stock-insider-newsletter/
Hard Money Trader - https://www.dailyreckoning.com.au/investment-services/hard-money-trader/

Step away from the headlines, they aren’t useful. It’s nothing but noise and misdirection.

Ignore the polls, cause they’re probably wrong.

Steady your hand investors, the markets will be twitchy over the next few weeks…but after watching today’s four exclusive interviews, you shouldn’t be.

Over the past two weeks I’ve spoken to some world-renowned experts and a couple of local Aussie experts.

My suggestion to you is make yourself a cuppa and set aside an hour, or carve out some time over the weekend so you really tune in. Hear what Jim, Rick, Bron and Hedley have to say. The outcome of the US election is so much more than who gets the Oval Office.

Let’s get started.

Jim Rickards, Editor of Strategic Intelligence Australia:

Way back in 2016, Jim told the world Donald Trump was going to win the US election. This statement flew in the face of the polls and the media that overwhelmingly favoured Hillary Clinton. Jim could make this call because few people understand the minutiae details like him. And in today’s interview, he breaks down exactly how the polls get it wrong.

Jim says the 2020 election is going to be a nail-biting finish and that you can’t rule Trump out just yet, despite what the polls say. If Biden wins, Jim says there’s a titbit in his tax policies that could see US investors dump stocks before Christmas…which would only increase the volatility in the markets.

""When Sam Peterson enrolled at Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa, he found the college experience mind-boggling. So too, he says, was figuring out how to vote in the 2018 midterm elections.

""Even though I had helped out with voter registration drives, I still felt confused about how to register. I didn't know what voting by mail was or absentee voting was,"" said Peterson, who is now 21 and a fellow with the left-leaning NextGen Iowa. ""So then, I was just really overwhelmed with school and with this voting thing, and so I didn't vote in 2018.”

That year, young voters turned out in historic numbers and were part of the coalition that helped to elect a Democratic House of Representatives. And with days until Election Day, signs have emerged that young voters are poised for another cycle of record turnout, particularly as young people are more likely than their older counterparts to vote in person and later in the election season.""

""Among the most respected and revelatory of polls is the annual survey of Americans’ opinions from the Public Religion Research Institute, which released this year’s survey earlier this week. It contains few surprises, but its detailed questioning of different subgroups confirms just how starkly we’re divided—above all, on issues of race.

First, to the one question uppermost in everyone’s mind, the poll found that Americans favored Joe Biden over Donald Trump by a 56 percent to 42 percent margin, when those “leaning” to one or the other candidate were factored in.

The one attitudinal (that is, not directly candidate related)question on the poll that produced the answer most at variance with the same question’s answer on a previous (2016) poll asked respondents whether they believed that “God granted the United States a special role in human history.” Every time that question had been previously posed, most Americans answered Yes—in 2016, by a 57 percent to 40 percent margin. This year, those figures were just about reversed: 58 percent said No, while just 40 percent said Yes (64 percent of Republicans still said Yes, but only 32 percent of Democrats did). We can only surmise that the cumulative effects of the pandemic, the natural disasters, the realization of police anti-Black violence, and the Trump presidency have made it harder for most Americans to believe we retain the favor of the Almighty.""

""Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, now personal attorney to President Donald Trump, had some tense moments on Fox Business on Tuesday and at one point threatened to walk off.
Lisa “Kennedy” Montgomery asked Giuliani about the Hunter Biden smear and conspiracy theories he’s pushed on Fox News and in the New York Post.

“Some could say you are acting like Christopher Steele,” she said, referring to the former British spy behind a salacious and unverified dossier on Trump. 

That set Giuliani off. 

“You better apologize for that!” he declared. “I’ve been a United States attorney, associate attorney general, mayor of New York City and a member of the bar for 50 years.” 

His voice rising, he called it an “outrageous defamation” to be compared to Steele.""

""When Sam Peterson enrolled at Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa, he found the college experience mind-boggling. So too, he says, was figuring out how to vote in the 2018 midterm elections.

""Even though I had helped out with voter registration drives, I still felt confused about how to register. I didn't know what voting by mail was or absentee voting was,"" said Peterson, who is now 21 and a fellow with the left-leaning NextGen Iowa. ""So then, I was just really overwhelmed with school and with this voting thing, and so I didn't vote in 2018.”

That year, young voters turned out in historic numbers and were part of the coalition that helped to elect a Democratic House of Representatives. And with days until Election Day, signs have emerged that young voters are poised for another cycle of record turnout, particularly as young people are more likely than their older counterparts to vote in person and later in the election season.""

""One month before a purported leak of files from Hunter Biden's laptop, a fake ""intelligence"" document about him went viral on the right-wing internet, asserting an elaborate conspiracy theory involving former Vice President Joe Biden's son and business in China.

The document, a 64-page composition that was later disseminated by close associates of President Donald Trump, appears to be the work of a fake ""intelligence firm"" called Typhoon Investigations, according to researchers and public documents.""*

""Utah State epidemiologist Dr. Angela Dunn responded to a new report that Utah's hospitals could soon be forced to ration care in Utah as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to strain the healthcare industry.

With new coronavirus cases shattering records on a daily basis, Utah’s hospitals are expected to begin rationing care in a week or two, The Salt Lake Tribune reports.

""This is NOT ok. It is maddening that we are planning to ration care in Utah. Unacceptable. We must do EVERYTHING we can to slow #COVID spread. No excuses,"" Dr. Dunn wrote in a tweet Monday morning.

That’s the prediction of Greg Bell, president of the Utah Hospital Association, who said administrators of the state’s hospitals confronted Gov. Gary Herbert on Thursday with a grim list: Criteria they propose doctors should use if they are forced to decide which patients can stay in overcrowded intensive care units.""

Imagine if Fox News Channel reported Trump news today like it used to report on the current events of President Obama's administration. US news today is as splintered as ever. When it comes to politics news, President Trump prefers Fox News over CNN TV, and right wing media like Fox News prefers him back. This NowThis News videos shows what it might look like if Fox News dropped its media bias on air to accurately report on Trump today and the current White House. How would Fox News report on the affordable care act, health care, and the justice department in this twilight zone? What would Sean Hannity say about Trump? The Trump Obama media split continues to have long lasting effects.

""The conspiracy theory that President Donald Trump pushed Monday that a plane “almost completely loaded with thugs” had been set to disrupt the Republican National Convention was almost identical to a rumor that went viral on Facebook three months ago.

In an interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham, Trump claimed that “we had somebody get on a plane from a certain city this weekend, and in the plane it was almost completely loaded with thugs, wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms, with gear and this and that.”

He then claimed the matter was “under investigation right now.”

There is no evidence of any such flight. When Ingraham asked for more information about the flight, the president said, ""I'll tell you sometime."" He then alleged the people had been headed to Washington to disrupt the RNC.""

Pres. Trump and his allies have argued for weeks that votes tallied after election night shouldn't count. 'The Election should end on November 3rd, not weeks later!' Trump tweeted. GOP officials say they may legally challenge votes not counted on Election Day. But no laws back up Trump's claims. Here are the facts:
1) Ballots are legally counted after Election Day in all 50 states
2) No state reports final results or certifies the winner on Election Day
3) In 29 states, military ballots can be received after Election Day, and in 18 states, ballots that arrive after Election Day are counted, per state law
4) Absentee & mail ballots take longer to count, with several processes done by hand; that doesn't mean late results are flawed or fraudulent
5) People voting by mail are disproportionately Democrats, so neither in-person ballots nor mail ballots reflect the full vote count

""Among the most respected and revelatory of polls is the annual survey of Americans’ opinions from the Public Religion Research Institute, which released this year’s survey earlier this week. It contains few surprises, but its detailed questioning of different subgroups confirms just how starkly we’re divided—above all, on issues of race.

First, to the one question uppermost in everyone’s mind, the poll found that Americans favored Joe Biden over Donald Trump by a 56 percent to 42 percent margin, when those “leaning” to one or the other candidate were factored in.

The one attitudinal (that is, not directly candidate related)question on the poll that produced the answer most at variance with the same question’s answer on a previous (2016) poll asked respondents whether they believed that “God granted the United States a special role in human history.” Every time that question had been previously posed, most Americans answered Yes—in 2016, by a 57 percent to 40 percent margin. This year, those figures were just about reversed: 58 percent said No, while just 40 percent said Yes (64 percent of Republicans still said Yes, but only 32 percent of Democrats did). We can only surmise that the cumulative effects of the pandemic, the natural disasters, the realization of police anti-Black violence, and the Trump presidency have made it harder for most Americans to believe we retain the favor of the Almighty.""

""US first lady Melania Trump has been filmed appearing to refuse to hold the hand of her husband President Donald Trump.

The footage, that was widely circulated on social media on Monday morning, was filmed on Sunday evening as they climbed down the steps of the president’s plane Air Force One.

In the footage, the president attempted to hold the first lady’s hand as they both left the aircraft, but Ms Trump seemingly moved her hand away from his.

The president then appeared to attempt to hold Ms Trump’s hand again, but the first lady moved it away, before he put his hand on her lower back as they walked down the steps in windy conditions.

Twitter users were mixed on the reason why the first lady repeatedly moved her hand away from the US president.""

Read more here: https://www.thedailybeast.com/scott-atlas-trumps-new-top-covid-adviser-is-reportedly-pushing-herd-immunity-strategy-on-president

""One of Donald Trump’s top new medical advisers is urging the White House to embrace a “herd immunity” strategy to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Herd-immunity strategies entail allowing disease to spread through much of the population, thereby building natural immunity to the deadly, highly contagious virus. Basing its reporting on “five people familiar with the discussions,” The Washington Post says the Trump White House has already begun to implement some policies along these lines. The approach’s chief proponent is Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist with no background in infectious diseases or epidemiology from Stanford’s conservative Hoover Institution. Atlas has advocated that the United States adopt the Swedish model, which relies on lifting restrictions so that healthy people can build up immunity to the disease rather than limiting social and business interactions to prevent the virus from spreading. Sweden has had among the highest infection and death rates in the world, leading many to denounce its policies as reckless; others have argued that despite a high initial surge of mortality, annual excess deaths may end the year broadly on par with trends for the country.”

Trump led him to conclude that Trump fails to grasp a fundamental truth: The “President has a moral responsibility to the larger public.” Instead, Woodward says Trump is “always thinking about himself” in how he makes decisions in office – a shortcoming that is more fundamental than any ideological or policy critiques of Trump. Woodward also discusses why Jared Kushner likened surviving this White House to being the Cheshire Cat in “Alice in Wonderland,” and Trump’s reliance on former foe Lindsey Graham, in this interview with MSNBC’s Ari Melber. (This interview is from MSNBC’s “The Beat with Ari Melber, a news show covering politics, law and culture airing nightly at 6pm ET on MSNBC. http://www.thebeatwithari.com). Aired on 09/25/2020.

""President Donald Trump lied about his policy accomplishments, interrupted himself, and went off on a series of incoherent rants during a recent interview with The Associated Press’ Julie Pace.

The AP released part of the interview last week, but made a fuller transcript available late Sunday. You can read it in full here, but beware: It’s a doozy. The phrase “Donald Trump is unintelligible” was even a top trending topic on Twitter early Monday ― referring to the 16 instances where the AP marked parts of the transcript “unintelligible.” (Pace later told the Toronto Star that one of Trump’s aides was talking over him at those moments, and that the aide did not want their comments included in the transcript. The Star notes that “this is itself highly unusual.”)

Here are some of the interview’s most bizarre moments:

Shunning reality, Trump said he’s “mostly there” on fulfilling the promises of his first 100 days.

With the 100-day mark looming on April 29, the president has fallen short on every one of the legislative goals he set last year in his “100-day action plan.” Most notably, the Republican health care bill that Trump campaigned extensively for went down in flames. He has also failed to secure funding for the wall he’s hoping to build along the U.S.-Mexico border.”*

In US news and current events today, in a recent press conference Trump lashed out at a reporter who quoted the president in his own words. 

‘Be nice. Don’t be threatening,’ Trump told reporter Yamiche Alcindor. 

A March 2020 survey of 213 American cities found widespread shortages of medical supplies. 85% of cities reported the need for more ventilators and 88% of cities said they lack protective equipment.

Four years on, he's presiding over a nation that is bitterly divided with a troubled economy and a population ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic.

With just over a week to go before polling day, Four Corners examines whether Donald Trump can once again defy the polls and his critics and secure a second presidential term.

Opinion polls are giving Democrat contender Joe Biden a decisive lead, and despite Donald Trump's insistence, even some of his most prominent supporters concede he has a battle on his hands.
