Sherrod Brown has also urged Biden to make one last stop in the state and emphasize his ‚ÄòBuild Back Better‚Äô economic vision for the future. After speaking in Cleveland, Biden will head back to Pennsylvania to make his final case to undecided voters in the swing state. No Republican has ever won the White House without carrying Ohio.

Pres. Trump and his allies have argued for weeks that votes tallied after election night shouldn't count. 'The Election should end on November 3rd, not weeks later!' Trump tweeted. GOP officials say they may legally challenge votes not counted on Election Day. But no laws back up Trump's claims. Here are the facts:
1) Ballots are legally counted after Election Day in all 50 states
2) No state reports final results or certifies the winner on Election Day
3) In 29 states, military ballots can be received after Election Day, and in 18 states, ballots that arrive after Election Day are counted, per state law
4) Absentee & mail ballots take longer to count, with several processes done by hand; that doesn't mean late results are flawed or fraudulent
5) People voting by mail are disproportionately Democrats, so neither in-person ballots nor mail ballots reflect the full vote count

Pres. Trump and his allies have argued for weeks that votes tallied after election night shouldn't count. 'The Election should end on November 3rd, not weeks later!' Trump tweeted. GOP officials say they may legally challenge votes not counted on Election Day. But no laws back up Trump's claims. Here are the facts:
1) Ballots are legally counted after Election Day in all 50 states
2) No state reports final results or certifies the winner on Election Day
3) In 29 states, military ballots can be received after Election Day, and in 18 states, ballots that arrive after Election Day are counted, per state law
4) Absentee & mail ballots take longer to count, with several processes done by hand; that doesn't mean late results are flawed or fraudulent
5) People voting by mail are disproportionately Democrats, so neither in-person ballots nor mail ballots reflect the full vote count

As the nation gears up for the presidential election, the ABC‚Äôs US Bureau Chief David Lipson takes us on a road trip through the northeast swing states to talk to ordinary people about the coming contest.  
 
Trump‚Äôs re-election looked like a certainty before the pandemic. Now, with the economy buckling under more lockdowns, COVID cases rising and civil unrest running in the streets, his grip on power looks more tenuous. 
 
As fringe groups arm themselves for conflict, will this fractured country survive the ultimate democratic stress-test? 
 
David meets Phil from the Michigan Liberty Militia who‚Äôs angry about his state‚Äôs lockdown orders describing them as ‚Äòa stomp on our constitutional rights‚Äô. In protest, the Michigan Patriots Militia took control of the State parliament in April. Now Phil warns a Trump defeat could get ugly. 
 
‚ÄòThere's a lot people out there that would not be able to handle that‚Ä¶ there is people‚Ä¶ that just think Trump is‚Ä¶like a God.‚Äù 
 
‚ÄòBikers for Trump‚Äô member Londa has kept her faith in Trump and is banking on him to deliver the prosperity America used to enjoy.  
 
‚ÄòHe doesn‚Äôt care what anybody thinks. He‚Äôs doing what‚Äôs best for the country.‚Äô   
 
In middle-class Ohio, a professional soccer mum with six children says she‚Äôs changed her mind about Trump because he‚Äôs ‚Äòunkind‚Äô.  
 
‚ÄòIt's just not the way that I would want my kids to be treating anybody ‚Äù. 
 
In Detroit, once the engine of America‚Äôs car industry, Dave meets African American woman Desha. She watched her husband die a painful death from COVID-19 and is now urging African Americans to come out and vote on election day.    
 
‚ÄúGotta do it. Like we have to, you have to, it is so much more important, you know, now than ever before.‚Äù

‚Ñπ More About This Video: 

In the previous video, found here: https://youtu.be/ApSXJ2ienHI , criminal defense attorney, Robert Gruler, covered the First Degree Intentional Homicide statute. If one of the affirmative defenses apply from the first video, then it is possible that the first degree intentional homicide charged will be dropped to the second degree. 



In this video, Rob covers what the second degree intentional homicide statue means and how this statute could affect Kyle Rittenhouse's case. Rob also quickly explains the Wisconsin statute for self- defense which is going to very important for Kyle's case.

Although Donald is known for his gregarious nature and Melania is considered shy, the pair shared an undeniable chemistry from the start. This is the truth about their marriage.

Donald first laid eyes on Melania Trump in 1998 at the Kit Kat Club in New York City, after being introduced by an Italian businessman. Melania revealed on Larry King Live: 

But in an interview with The New York Post, Melania's friend Edit Molnar said that Donald was there with another woman, so Melania didn't entertain his advances.

But The Donald was smitten. The President-to-be told Tatler: 

""I'd seen her before, on the runways and things, but her beauty utterly amazed me."" 

Even though his playboy friends told him not to waste his time because they'd already tried to court her, he persisted and asked for Melania's number. Melania recalled:

""But I didn't give it to him, because I knew who he was [...] He had all these ladies, so I [wanted] to see what kind of number he [would] give to me."" 

Although she was skeptical, Donald didn't give her his business line, but his personal digits. She called him a few days later and the rest is history. Watch the video to hear more Details Revealed About Donald Trump And Melania's Marriage!

But while most of the Trumps are making headlines, one family member has managed to skirt the spotlight. 14-year-old Barron Trump is the only son of President Trump and the First Lady - and here's what America's First Kid is all about!

Barron Trump is one of five children, from Donald's three marriages. Barron's older brothers, Donald Jr. and Eric, are the children of Donald and his first wife, Ivana. Also from the first marriage is Ivanka, who works as an official assistant to the President, while her husband, Jared Kushner, is a senior adviser. 

Barron's two older brothers often appear in the spotlight due to their leading roles in The Trump Organization. And all three of the older kids made appearances during their father's campaign, speaking at both the 2016 and the 2020 Republican National Conventions. The siblings were also joined by their younger sister, Tiffany, from Donald's second marriage to Marla Maples, who spoke in support of her father, as well.

While Barron may have been absent from the official podium, we're certain he would have been speaking, too, if he were just a little older. And, it's not like he isn't familiar with being on TV‚Ä¶ Keep watching to learn The Truth About Donald And Melania Trump's Only Son!

""Pat is a programmer at a large software company. At best, he‚Äôs a middling performer; his code is a mess (initializing variables that are never used, using variable names no one else understands, etc.), he takes longer than he should, and he doesn‚Äôt even remember his own code months later.

But Pat‚Äôs poor coding skills aren‚Äôt his most annoying attribute. What frustrates his manager the most is that Pat is absolutely convinced that he‚Äôs a great programmer. Last month was Pat‚Äôs performance review, and after receiving a low score from his manager, Pat incredulously argued:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm one of the best programmers in this department! What kind of rating scale are you even using if someone with my talent can get a low score? There‚Äôs no way that your performance review form is accurately assessing my abilities. Or maybe you‚Äôre just assessing a bunch of stuff that has nothing to do with actually being a programmer!‚Äù


If you‚Äôve ever dealt with someone whose performance stinks, and they‚Äôre not only clueless that their performance stinks but they‚Äôre confident that their performance is good, you likely saw the Dunning-Kruger Effect in action.""

""President Donald Trump lied about his policy accomplishments, interrupted himself, and went off on a series of incoherent rants during a recent interview with The Associated Press‚Äô Julie Pace.

The AP released part of the interview last week, but made a fuller transcript available late Sunday. You can read it in full here, but beware: It‚Äôs a doozy. The phrase ‚ÄúDonald Trump is unintelligible‚Äù was even a top trending topic on Twitter early Monday ‚Äï referring to the 16 instances where the AP marked parts of the transcript ‚Äúunintelligible.‚Äù (Pace later told the Toronto Star that one of Trump‚Äôs aides was talking over him at those moments, and that the aide did not want their comments included in the transcript. The Star notes that ‚Äúthis is itself highly unusual.‚Äù)

Here are some of the interview‚Äôs most bizarre moments:

Shunning reality, Trump said he‚Äôs ‚Äúmostly there‚Äù on fulfilling the promises of his first 100 days.

With the 100-day mark looming on April 29, the president has fallen short on every one of the legislative goals he set last year in his ‚Äú100-day action plan.‚Äù Most notably, the Republican health care bill that Trump campaigned extensively for went down in flames. He has also failed to secure funding for the wall he‚Äôs hoping to build along the U.S.-Mexico border.‚Äù*

FYI, Laura Ingraham's radio show has been canceled due to advertisers boycotting her show for mocking Parkland survivor, David Hogg. She's still on Fox News attacking immigrants, refugees, Muslims, the Obamas, LeBron James and other groups she's not a fan of.

Though Pres. Trump won Ohio by over 8% in 2016, the Biden campaign has spent significant time and money in the swing state hoping to connect with industrial, middle-class voters. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown has also urged Biden to make one last stop in the state and emphasize his ‚ÄòBuild Back Better‚Äô economic vision for the future. After speaking in Cleveland, Biden will head back to Pennsylvania to make his final case to undecided voters in the swing state. No Republican has ever won the White House without carrying Ohio.

Pres. Trump and his allies have argued for weeks that votes tallied after election night shouldn't count. 'The Election should end on November 3rd, not weeks later!' Trump tweeted. GOP officials say they may legally challenge votes not counted on Election Day. But no laws back up Trump's claims. Here are the facts:
1) Ballots are legally counted after Election Day in all 50 states
2) No state reports final results or certifies the winner on Election Day
3) In 29 states, military ballots can be received after Election Day, and in 18 states, ballots that arrive after Election Day are counted, per state law
4) Absentee & mail ballots take longer to count, with several processes done by hand; that doesn't mean late results are flawed or fraudulent
5) People voting by mail are disproportionately Democrats, so neither in-person ballots nor mail ballots reflect the full vote count

The drive-thru polling locations allowed any registered voter to cast their ballot in a car instead of going inside polling centers, as polls show a close race between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden in Texas, a traditionally Republican state. Susan Hays, a special counsel to Harris County on election matters, says the drive-thru locations have been ""enormously popular"" during the pandemic, and tossing those ballots undermines the democratic process. ""An election contest is the remedy to any issues with the voting process, not lawsuits that happen before the election,"" she says.

We speak with Mother Jones senior writer Ari Berman, author of ""Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America,"" who says the Supreme Court could yet decide who wins the presidency if a close result leads to legal challenges. ""My message to voters in these states and other states is drop your ballot off,"" says Berman. ""Don't leave it to chance that your vote could be thrown out.""
