The answer to that question is a calculated formula that dollar stores have devised to keep prices low, and we're going to break it down.

Location is the name of the game in business and if a company wants to be in the busy part of town it's going to cost them. However, it's not uncommon to see dollar stores in lower-income sections of a city, or in a totally rural area. It's a smart business move, and choosing to operate in areas that Target, Walmart, or Whole Foods won't bother to go has proven highly effective for the growth of dollar stores. 

Opening and operating in these areas is simply less expensive and this helps keep prices down. Many dollar stores don't buy the land their stores are on either, which means that if they're not doing well, they can just pick up and move. If a Dollar General can keep the lights on and skip out on the pricey property taxes that a Publix is going to pay, it's going to be able to sell its food for much cheaper.

Watch the video to learn why food at the dollar store is really so cheap!

No mRNA vaccine has ever been approved by the FDA, but Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech hope to receive emergency approval based on preliminary data from their ongoing vaccine trials.  

Moderna's two-dose vaccine regimen does not require special refrigeration (the Pfizer vaccine is supposed to be stored at -70 Celcius) but a variety of questions remain:
Will the vaccine prevent transmission and asymptomatic spread?  
How long will immunity last?  
Will “94.5% effective” hold up to peer-review and additional data when it is gathered?

Over 40% of American adults, and approximately 1 billion people worldwide are deficient in vitamin D. That’s a lot of people walking around lacking in this vital nutrient. As you may already know, lack of vitamins or a vitamin deficiency can cause serious health consequences if not addressed.

Because low vitamin D levels are affecting so many people across the globe, it’s important to learn the signs and symptoms of vitamin D deficiency. Since vitamin D has receptors throughout the body, it’s imperative that you get adequate amounts in order to stay healthy.

If you suspect that you may need more vitamin D based on this list, it’s best to talk to your doctor and get your blood levels checked. The good news is that a deficiency of vitamin D is easy to fix if your levels are lower than adequate. You can either you get more sunlight, consume more foods high in Vitamin D, or take a supplement.

aIvRR_y5i-k,Dr. John Campbell,UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg,1602802062.0,COVID-19 and Zinc,"President Trump taking zinc (WSJ)

https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-takes-zinc-maybe-you-should-too-11601916665

Low zinc levels at clinical admission associates with poor outcomes in COVID-19, (11th October)

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.07.20208645v1

Zinc balances immune responses and also has a proven direct antiviral action against some viruses.

Zinc deficiency (ZD) is a common condition in elderly and individuals with chronic diseases

Increased intracellular zinc concentrations efficiently impair replication

Resulting in a lower number of viruses

Retrospective analysis

Patients admitted in Barcelona

15th March to 30th April 2020

Clinical severity of COVID-19 and PMH assessed

Fasting plasma zinc levels measured routinely at admission

N = 611

Mean age, 63 years

Male 332, (55%) 

Total mortality was 87 patients (14%) during study time

But

249 of 611 patients studied

Of the 249, 21 (8%) died

Baseline zinc levels

Died, (21 people) mean plasma zinc = 43 μg/dl

Survived, (228 people) mean plasma zinc = 63.1 μg/dl

Higher zinc levels, associated with lower maximum levels of interleukin-6 during the period of active infection

Zinc level lower than 50 μg/dl at admission, 2.3 times increased risk of in-hospital death

Compared with those of 50 μg/dl or higher

Lower zinc levels at admission correlate with higher inflammation in the course of infection and poorer outcome 

Low plasma zinc levels at admission are associated with mortality in COVID-19 in our study 

Further studies are needed to assess the therapeutic impact of this association

COVID-19: Poor outcomes in patients with zinc deficiency (International Journal of Infectious Diseases, November 2020)

Chennai, India

Prospective study of fasting zinc levels in COVID-19 patients at the time of hospitalization

Healthy controls median 105.8 μg/dl

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197122030730X

Zinc is a trace element with potent immunoregulatory and antiviral properties

Is utilized in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

Patients with serious COVID-19 had significantly low zinc levels in comparison to healthy controls

Zinc deficient COVID patients developed more complications

Zinc deficient patients 70.4% developed complications

Non zinc deficient patients, 30.0% developed complications, (p = 0.009)

Acute respiratory distress syndrome

More need of steroids

Increased mortality

Zinc deficient COVID patients had a prolonged hospital stay

Zinc deficient patients, 7.9 days

Non zinc deficient patients, 5.7 days, (p = 0.048)

In vitro studies

Reduced zinc levels increase SARS-CoV-2 virus receptor interactions

Increased zinc levels inhibit ACE2 expression


https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-HealthProfessional/

What zinc does

Catalytic activity of approximately 100 enzymes 

Plays a role in immune function

Protein synthesis

Wound healing

DNA synthesis 

Cell division

Normal growth and development, pregnancy, childhood, adolescence

Required for sense of taste and smell

Zinc and immunity

Severe zinc deficiency depresses immune function

Even mild to moderate degrees of zinc deficiency can impair macrophage and neutrophil functions, natural killer cell activity, and complement activity

Body requires zinc to develop and activate T-lymphocytes

Low zinc levels have shown reduced lymphocyte proliferation

…. that can be corrected by zinc supplementation 

Low zinc status has been associated with increased susceptibility to pneumonia and other infections in children in developing countries and the elderly

At the end of the 18th century, the English author Robert Louis Stevenson is said to have received the inspiration for his novel „Treasure Island“ here. 

The tiny island comprises just 25 sqm² and is covered by an impenetrable jungle. Numerous streams, waterfalls and gorges epitomise the world‘s largest uninhabited rain forest island. Due to its isolation, unique flora and fauna have developed here. Today, as a national park and world natural heritage, the island is closely supervised by park rangers. 

The outstanding underwater world surrounding the island abounds with marine fauna of every description. Hardly any other destination is as well-known for its countless large fish varieties, especially hammerhead, reef and offshore sharks. The film‘s author submerged to depths up to 400 meters on board the „Deep Sea“, a modern research submarine. During the dive, he ucceeded in shooting material of rare deep sea fish and shark species, which have never before been sighted near Coconut Island.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/49FFwqAVxlg/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-21 14:41:02.004115,Neutral,0.0,['None'],Neutral,False,3,ha2mLz-Xdpg,0,Election

How to fix shoulder pain at home with these exercises: https://youtu.be/J-s1rIUNsOA



Precision Wellbeing's Osteopath Ashley Ridout goes into depth as to why most people he sees have shoulder pain.


The most common cause is over-tightness of the shoulder muscles which leads on to the development of tendinitis or bursitis.

In many cases shoulder pain can be overcome through stretching the shoulders with a strength band and using massage balls to reduce the tightness.

In this video Ashley discusses the anatomy of the shoulder including the muscles of the rotator cuff and touches on some of the issues that can arise.

Ashley then goes on to show you the tests that he finds most useful in screening shoulder pain followed by the stretches and massage ball techniques he finds most useful.

This video will hopefully be useful for those who suffer from chronic shoulder pain, tendinitis, bursitis, rotator cuff injuries or just want to simply increase their overall shoulder health.

Dr. Seheult illustrates the differences and similarities between the AstraZeneca / Oxford vaccine candidate and those from Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech.  

The complete data from each of these SARS CoV 2 vaccine trials have not been released nor peer-reviewed at this time, and none of the COVID 19 vaccines have received FDA authorization to date. 

Dr. Sheult explains some of the potential advantages of the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine candidate including a lower cost and that it only requires regular refrigeration. (This video was recorded on November 24, 2020).

During this lecture we will be discussing COVID-19 vaccines including Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, and Astrazeneca/Oxford. 

We are NOT sponsored and/or endorsed by Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, or Astrazeneca. We are presenting on RESEARCH and in no way is any of the information provided our own view or opinions. 

This will be a lecture packed with the process vaccine developers must go through; which includes a preclinical phase and phases I-III. Including information about OPERATION WARP SPEED and how this has expedited the normally lengthy vaccine process. 

We will then discuss how Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, and Astrazeneca vaccines work in the human body, preventing the SARS-CoV-2 virus and hopefully, ending this global pandemic. 

Finally-- Zach presents on all of the most current data that each of the vaccine companies have released outlining the vaccine procedure and how it will be administered, the vaccine efficacy (as a percentage), optimal storage temperature of the vaccine in order to remain viable, and the number of vaccine units these companies are capable of producing. 

IMPORTANT INFO (MUST READ):
One thing to emphasize that wasn’t harped on enough from this lecture is when these vaccines lead to an immunogenic reaction as we described above, which leads to formation of Memory B cells and Memory T cells. This is important because if we are exposed to the virus those memory cells are now primed and able to recognize and mount a powerful immune response against the virus. 

LASTLY, one additional point and clarification is when those cytotoxic T cells produce destructive molecules that damage host cells it’s important to realize that those are memory cytotoxic T cells primed by the Vaccine that damage host cells that ARE INFECTED with the SARS-COV-2 virus, NOT CELLS processing the vaccine. 

Big Takeaway:
1. Vaccine stimulates antibody production to protect against virus IF INFECTED.
2. Vaccine stimulates development of memory T and B cells to protect against virus IF INFECTED.

bMiZbjUEjy4,PBS NewsHour,UC6ZFN9Tx6xh-skXCuRHCDpQ,1602716440.0,WATCH: Sen. Ted Cruz questions Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett,"Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, questioned Judge Amy Coney Barrett on Oct. 14, the third day of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing. During his line of questioning, he criticized Democrats’ “assault on the Federalist Society” and its efforts to appoint conservative judges like Barrett to the federal bench. Cruz also said policy disputes over issues such as health care and school choice are best handled by the legislature, rather than the judiciary. “It’s not a judge’s role” to mandate policies favored by either Republicans or Democrats, he argued. Lastly, he expressed concern over the idea of “packing the court” with more justices, a move that is favored by some progressives but has not been endorsed by top Democrats or the party’s presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden. The hearing came about three weeks before Election Day. The third of four days of scheduled testimony gave senators another opportunity to ask Barrett about her record and approach to the law.

It is now exclusively an American community. The General ate of the Congregation is located in Auburn, Kentucky.

Some US lawmakers, along with legislators in Europe, are becoming increasingly concerned these companies have violated antitrust laws and are exercising monopoly power to crush smaller competitors.

The hearing was 5 hours long, and see-sawed back and forth between questions about supposed anti-conservative bias in social media, and questions that actually had to do with the market power of these companies, along with one representative asking Sundar Pichai for technical support with his email.

With all that, here are a few of the questions that we thought were the most important to the issues at hand.

Are Trump allies peddling Russian disinformation about the Bidens?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQX-XSCMMdY

Why talking to Ukrainian officials disproves the Trump narrative on Biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUSU_JDClE
--------
Pam Bondi, the former attorney general of Florida who is a member of the Trump impeachment legal team, outlined on Jan. 27 the concerns she said the president had about potential corruption on the part of the Bidens in Ukraine. Bondi pointed to numerous news reports raising questions about Hunter Biden’s appointment to the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma. The move “looks nepotistic at best, nefarious at worst,” Bondi said, speaking on the Senate floor during the impeachment trial. 

While some ethics experts have said Hunter Biden’s seat on the Burisma board could raise the appearance of a conflict of interest, independent news reports have found no wrongdoing by Hunter Biden or former vice president Joe Biden. 

Democrats argue Trump used the idea of corruption as a cover for efforts to get Ukraine to investigate his political rival. Trump’s defense team is presenting their arguments as part of the Senate impeachment trial. The trial has entered a pivotal week as his defense team resumes its case and senators face a critical vote on whether to hear witnesses or proceed directly to a vote that is widely expected to end in his acquittal. The articles of impeachment charge Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The House of Representatives impeached the president in December on those two counts.

The Democratic candidate told the debate in Nashville, Tennessee: ""Anyone who's responsible for that many deaths should not remain president of the United States of America.

""He says we're, you know, learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it.""

Mr Trump responded by saying: ""We're rounding the corner. It's going away,"" adding that ""we can't close up our nation or we won't have one"".

The White House has already signalled it’s setting the pomp and ceremony switch to extreme because the US-Australia relationship is so vital. But there could be problems. Two former high-profile Trump aides, Omarosa Manigault Newman and Anthony Scaramucci, have turned on the President and are now revealing damaging details about the inner workings of the White House. And as Karl Stefanovic reports, one of the most embarrassing claims is that the supposed “unbreakable” alliance between our two countries, far from being Trumped, was almost dumped.

The President of the United States is often referred to as the most powerful man in the world. But Donald Trump’s niece, Mary Trump says the current POTUS is really the most dangerous man in the world. She is so troubled by Trump’s abuse of his position that she says it’s her patriotic duty to take him down. And to do that she has written a brutal tell-all memoir. As Liam Bartlett discovers in an Australian television exclusive interview, the book is the ultimate insider’s account of a truly dysfunctional family.

7B_lN3RbXFs,ZDFheute Nachrichten,UCeqKIgPQfNInOswGRWt48kQ,1605851076.0,Barack Obama über Politik und Privates | Markus Lanz vom 19. November 2020,"Der ehemalige Präsident der USA, Barack Obama, spricht in einem ausführlichen Interview mit Markus Lanz über die aktuelle politische Lage in Amerika. Er sei nicht überrascht, dass Präsident Donald Trump seine Wahlniederlage nicht wirklich anerkennt. Es verhindere allerdings den rei-bungslosen Amtsantritt Joe Bidens, so Obama. Er erinnert sich daran, wie reibungslos und ange-nehm der Regierungswechsel zwischen George W. Bush und ihm geklappt hatte - und das trotz großer politischer Differenzen. „Aber ich freue mich sehr für Joe Biden und Kamala Harris. Sie sind langjährige Freunde und werden großartige Arbeit leisten“, verkündet der 59-Jährige. 
Obama blickt im Interview auch auf seine Zeit als Präsident zurück. Weil er so viele Drohungen, wie keiner seiner Vorgänger bekommen hat, seien die Sicherheitsvorkehrungen für ihn und seine Familie immer besonders hoch gewesen. Umso wichtiger war es seiner Frau, Michelle Obama, das Weiße Haus wohnlich, modern und kindgerecht zu gestalten, erzählt der ehemalige US-Präsident. 
In seinen gerade erschienenen Memoiren gewährt Barack Obama viele Einblicke in sein Leben als Ehemann, Vater und Präsident. 

Die ganze Analyse des Interviews findet ihr hier:  https://kurz.zdf.de/ib6l/

Julius van de Laar, Strategieberater
Der USA-Experte gehörte zum Wahlkampfteam Obamas. Er bilanziert das innen- und weltpoliti-sche Agieren des ersten schwarzen Präsidenten der Vereinigten Staaten von Amerika.
 
Sandra Navidi, Juristin
Die in New York lebende Börsenexpertin spricht über die Wirtschaftspolitik Obamas, die unmittel-bar nach dessen Amtsübernahme geprägt war von der Bewältigung der Finanzkrise.

Dr. Seheult illustrates the differences and similarities between the AstraZeneca / Oxford vaccine candidate and those from Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech.  

The complete data from each of these SARS CoV 2 vaccine trials have not been released nor peer-reviewed at this time, and none of the COVID 19 vaccines have received FDA authorization to date. 

Dr. Sheult explains some of the potential advantages of the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine candidate including a lower cost and that it only requires regular refrigeration. (This video was recorded on November 24, 2020).

Roger Seheult, MD is the co-founder and lead professor at https://www.medcram.com
He is Board Certified in Internal Medicine, Pulmonary Disease, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine and an Associate Professor at the University of California, Riverside School of Medicine.

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: http://www.pbs.org/donate 

In a nine-month investigation that takes FRONTLINE and NPR from Dallas to Miami, NPR’s Laura Sullivan and FRONTLINE’s Rick Young find that just one in four households eligible for Section 8 assistance are getting it, and the nation’s signature low-income housing construction program is costing more and producing less. The team investigates the inseparability of race and housing programs in America, tracing a legacy of segregation and discrimination that began more than 80 years ago.

daj6uTQZD9w,Mashed,UCGvIBxqin_rx3sY9qacQEhQ,1574402084.0,Why Food At The Dollar Store Is Really So Cheap,"How are dollar stores are able to sell food for so cheap and still turn a profit? The answer to that question is a calculated formula that dollar stores have devised to keep prices low, and we're going to break it down.

Location is the name of the game in business and if a company wants to be in the busy part of town it's going to cost them. However, it's not uncommon to see dollar stores in lower-income sections of a city, or in a totally rural area. It's a smart business move, and choosing to operate in areas that Target, Walmart, or Whole Foods won't bother to go has proven highly effective for the growth of dollar stores. 

Opening and operating in these areas is simply less expensive and this helps keep prices down. Many dollar stores don't buy the land their stores are on either, which means that if they're not doing well, they can just pick up and move. If a Dollar General can keep the lights on and skip out on the pricey property taxes that a Publix is going to pay, it's going to be able to sell its food for much cheaper.

Watch the video to learn why food at the dollar store is really so cheap!

No mRNA vaccine has ever been approved by the FDA, but Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech hope to receive emergency approval based on preliminary data from their ongoing vaccine trials.  

Moderna's two-dose vaccine regimen does not require special refrigeration (the Pfizer vaccine is supposed to be stored at -70 Celcius) but a variety of questions remain:
Will the vaccine prevent transmission and asymptomatic spread?  
How long will immunity last?  
Will “94.5% effective” hold up to peer-review and additional data when it is gathered?

Over 40% of American adults, and approximately 1 billion people worldwide are deficient in vitamin D. That’s a lot of people walking around lacking in this vital nutrient. As you may already know, lack of vitamins or a vitamin deficiency can cause serious health consequences if not addressed.

Because low vitamin D levels are affecting so many people across the globe, it’s important to learn the signs and symptoms of vitamin D deficiency. Since vitamin D has receptors throughout the body, it’s imperative that you get adequate amounts in order to stay healthy.

If you suspect that you may need more vitamin D based on this list, it’s best to talk to your doctor and get your blood levels checked. The good news is that a deficiency of vitamin D is easy to fix if your levels are lower than adequate. You can either you get more sunlight, consume more foods high in Vitamin D, or take a supplement.

At the end of the 18th century, the English author Robert Louis Stevenson is said to have received the inspiration for his novel „Treasure Island“ here. 

The tiny island comprises just 25 sqm² and is covered by an impenetrable jungle. Numerous streams, waterfalls and gorges epitomise the world‘s largest uninhabited rain forest island. Due to its isolation, unique flora and fauna have developed here. Today, as a national park and world natural heritage, the island is closely supervised by park rangers. 

The outstanding underwater world surrounding the island abounds with marine fauna of every description. Hardly any other destination is as well-known for its countless large fish varieties, especially hammerhead, reef and offshore sharks. The film‘s author submerged to depths up to 400 meters on board the „Deep Sea“, a modern research submarine. During the dive, he ucceeded in shooting material of rare deep sea fish and shark species, which have never before been sighted near Coconut Island.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/49FFwqAVxlg/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-21 14:41:50.131321,Neutral,0.0,['None'],Neutral,False,3,ha2mLz-Xdpg,4,Gavin Newsom

https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-takes-zinc-maybe-you-should-too-11601916665

Low zinc levels at clinical admission associates with poor outcomes in COVID-19, (11th October)

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.07.20208645v1

Zinc balances immune responses and also has a proven direct antiviral action against some viruses.

Zinc deficiency (ZD) is a common condition in elderly and individuals with chronic diseases

Increased intracellular zinc concentrations efficiently impair replication

Resulting in a lower number of viruses

Retrospective analysis

Patients admitted in Barcelona

15th March to 30th April 2020

Clinical severity of COVID-19 and PMH assessed

Fasting plasma zinc levels measured routinely at admission

N = 611

Mean age, 63 years

Male 332, (55%) 

Total mortality was 87 patients (14%) during study time

But

249 of 611 patients studied

Of the 249, 21 (8%) died

Baseline zinc levels

Died, (21 people) mean plasma zinc = 43 μg/dl

Survived, (228 people) mean plasma zinc = 63.1 μg/dl

Higher zinc levels, associated with lower maximum levels of interleukin-6 during the period of active infection

Zinc level lower than 50 μg/dl at admission, 2.3 times increased risk of in-hospital death

Compared with those of 50 μg/dl or higher

Lower zinc levels at admission correlate with higher inflammation in the course of infection and poorer outcome 

Low plasma zinc levels at admission are associated with mortality in COVID-19 in our study 

Further studies are needed to assess the therapeutic impact of this association

COVID-19: Poor outcomes in patients with zinc deficiency (International Journal of Infectious Diseases, November 2020)

Chennai, India

Prospective study of fasting zinc levels in COVID-19 patients at the time of hospitalization

Healthy controls median 105.8 μg/dl

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197122030730X

Zinc is a trace element with potent immunoregulatory and antiviral properties

Is utilized in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

Patients with serious COVID-19 had significantly low zinc levels in comparison to healthy controls

Zinc deficient COVID patients developed more complications

Zinc deficient patients 70.4% developed complications

Non zinc deficient patients, 30.0% developed complications, (p = 0.009)

Acute respiratory distress syndrome

More need of steroids

Increased mortality

Zinc deficient COVID patients had a prolonged hospital stay

Zinc deficient patients, 7.9 days

Non zinc deficient patients, 5.7 days, (p = 0.048)

In vitro studies

Reduced zinc levels increase SARS-CoV-2 virus receptor interactions

Increased zinc levels inhibit ACE2 expression

What zinc does

Catalytic activity of approximately 100 enzymes 

Plays a role in immune function

Protein synthesis

Wound healing

DNA synthesis 

Cell division

Normal growth and development, pregnancy, childhood, adolescence

Required for sense of taste and smell

Zinc and immunity

Severe zinc deficiency depresses immune function

Even mild to moderate degrees of zinc deficiency can impair macrophage and neutrophil functions, natural killer cell activity, and complement activity

Body requires zinc to develop and activate T-lymphocytes

Low zinc levels have shown reduced lymphocyte proliferation

…. that can be corrected by zinc supplementation 

Low zinc status has been associated with increased susceptibility to pneumonia and other infections in children in developing countries and the elderly

How to fix shoulder pain at home with these exercises: https://youtu.be/J-s1rIUNsOA



Precision Wellbeing's Osteopath Ashley Ridout goes into depth as to why most people he sees have shoulder pain.


The most common cause is over-tightness of the shoulder muscles which leads on to the development of tendinitis or bursitis.

In many cases shoulder pain can be overcome through stretching the shoulders with a strength band and using massage balls to reduce the tightness.

In this video Ashley discusses the anatomy of the shoulder including the muscles of the rotator cuff and touches on some of the issues that can arise.

Ashley then goes on to show you the tests that he finds most useful in screening shoulder pain followed by the stretches and massage ball techniques he finds most useful.

This video will hopefully be useful for those who suffer from chronic shoulder pain, tendinitis, bursitis, rotator cuff injuries or just want to simply increase their overall shoulder health.

35Idb_lCU4o,Ninja Nerd Lectures,UC6QYFutt9cluQ3uSM963_KQ,1607333668.0,COVID-19 Vaccines: MODERNA | PFIZER/BIONTECH | ASTRAZENECA,"#COVID19 #coronavirus #vaccines 

During this lecture we will be discussing COVID-19 vaccines including Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, and Astrazeneca/Oxford. 

We are NOT sponsored and/or endorsed by Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, or Astrazeneca. We are presenting on RESEARCH and in no way is any of the information provided our own view or opinions. 

This will be a lecture packed with the process vaccine developers must go through; which includes a preclinical phase and phases I-III. Including information about OPERATION WARP SPEED and how this has expedited the normally lengthy vaccine process. 

We will then discuss how Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, and Astrazeneca vaccines work in the human body, preventing the SARS-CoV-2 virus and hopefully, ending this global pandemic. 

Finally-- Zach presents on all of the most current data that each of the vaccine companies have released outlining the vaccine procedure and how it will be administered, the vaccine efficacy (as a percentage), optimal storage temperature of the vaccine in order to remain viable, and the number of vaccine units these companies are capable of producing. 

IMPORTANT INFO (MUST READ):
One thing to emphasize that wasn’t harped on enough from this lecture is when these vaccines lead to an immunogenic reaction as we described above, which leads to formation of Memory B cells and Memory T cells. This is important because if we are exposed to the virus those memory cells are now primed and able to recognize and mount a powerful immune response against the virus. 

LASTLY, one additional point and clarification is when those cytotoxic T cells produce destructive molecules that damage host cells it’s important to realize that those are memory cytotoxic T cells primed by the Vaccine that damage host cells that ARE INFECTED with the SARS-COV-2 virus, NOT CELLS processing the vaccine. 

Big Takeaway:
1. Vaccine stimulates antibody production to protect against virus IF INFECTED.
2. Vaccine stimulates development of memory T and B cells to protect against virus IF INFECTED.
