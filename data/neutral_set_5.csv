Ji Su’s life as a 1.5 generation immigrant has made her passionate about empowering young, lower-class immigrants. She wishes to become a spokesperson for their great strength and limitless potential.

Claire and Ru Callender are self taught, award winning ceremonial undertakers and sextons who set up The Green Funeral Company in 2000. Their stripped back, naturalistic approach is informed by their own experiences of bereavement and the unsatisfactory funerals that followed, and their practice has unusual and diverse influences including the natural death movement, rave culture, Quakerism, hospices, punk, and crop circles.

They aim to create rituals that are practical, satisfying and unique but feel profound and genuine, and their intentions can be summed up in three words: Honesty, appropriateness and participation.

They have strong feelings about the funeral industry, particularly embalming, current cremation practice and design, family disempowerment, corporate takeovers, assembly line rituals, faux Victorian aesthetics, inappropriate religious services and exploitative and unnecessary prepayment schemes.

The North American leap from a culture of healthy death acceptance to a culture of death denial has been no leap at all.  It’s been a journey of small steps.  And this journey has, in part, been enabled by both the professionalization of death and the funeral industry. In this talk, Caleb explores options that help us pursue death acceptance by taking back death care responsibilities.

His revelation in the performing arts led him on a quest to find the secret behind how such moments of realisation could be triggered – and he just might’ve found it.

However, he participates with diligence, enthusiasm and of course, sarcasm. Evan takes a particular interest in the sciences and performing arts.

""An activist delivered an impassioned speech during a meeting of the Kansas City Board of Police Commissioners that has gone viral on social media.

The board's monthly meeting ended abruptly after a stream of activists, clergy and community groups demanded the board take a vote to remove Rick Smith, the police chief in Kansas City, Missouri.

But before it ended, one of those activists, Keiajah Brooks, called out Smith for using photo opportunities with Black children for PR purposes while being complicit in their ""oppression and denigration.""*

""The White House’s science policy office on Tuesday ranked “ending the Covid-19 pandemic” atop the list of President Donald Trump’s top first-term accomplishments, even as the country registers record amounts of infections and hospitals fill up again.

The list, included in a press release from the Office of Science and Technology Policy credits the administration for taking “decisive actions to engage scientists and health professionals in academia, industry, and government to understand, treat, and defeat the disease.”

It’s the latest inaccurate claim from the administration on the severity of the pandemic, which Trump has downplayed throughout his reelection campaign, and as Vice President Mike Pence’s office is dealing with an outbreak. Trump, who insists the country is ""rounding the turn"" on the coronavirus, continues to hold packed campaign rallies and attacks the news media for focusing on surging infections.""

""A sudden drop in the stock market in recent days threatens to muddle President Trump’s campaign message about the U.S. economic recovery, just days before the Nov. 3 election.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 943 points Wednesday and is down nearly 9 percent since Sept. 2.

The sell-off began two weeks ago but intensified Monday. It has been triggered by a surge in coronavirus cases and the fact that the White House and Democrats are at an impasse over relief talks.""*

Many of those at the rally at the Eppley Airfield faced hours in long lines to get in and clogged parking lots and busy crowds to get out, hours after his Air Force One departed around 9 p.m. Crowds cleared about 12:30 a.m.

According to dispatches from Omaha Police department, recorded by radio communications platform, Broadcastify, at least 30 people including the elderly, an electric wheelchair user and a family with small children were among those requiring medical attention after hours of waiting in the cold at the rally at the Eppley Airfield.""

Narrated By Julianne Moore | NowThis,"Donald Trump is the only presidential candidate on the ballot who has publicly agreed that his own daughter is a 'piece of ass.' The bronze-gilded mogul is as notable for his multiple rape allegations and history of racist renting practices as he is for putting children in cages and shamelessly funding a campaign to execute 5 innocent Black teens.
So how did the man who once said he’d choose Oprah as his running mate end up with yet another campaign endorsement from former KKK grand wizard David Duke? 🗣 Narrated by Julianne Moore.

In US news and current events today, Donald Trump made headlines after he walked out of his '60 Minutes' interview with Lesley Stahl after only 35 minutes. Trump then leaked the full interview himself.

The interview begins with Lesley Stahl asking Donald Trump, 'You're ok with some tough questions?' and Trump responding, 'No, I'm not.' 

Lesley Stahl repeatedly presses President Trump to share his health care plan, to explain the rise in COVID-19 cases, to justify why he called Dr. Anthony Fauci an 'idiot,' and more. At one point, Trump explicitly states that he hopes the Supreme Court 'ends' Obamacare.

Federal intelligence and security agencies say white supremacist extremists pose America's deadliest domestic terror threat. The shocking evidence was on full view last week when the FBI busted a plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and overthrow the government. Elizabeth Neumann was assistant secretary for threat prevention at the Department for Homeland Security under President Trump. She says her repeated attempts to flag the dangers of these racist groups were ignored. A lifelong Republican, Neumann will not vote for the GOP this election cycle, as she explains to Hari Sreenivasan.

In US news and current events today, Donald Trump made headlines after he walked out of his '60 Minutes' interview with Lesley Stahl after only 35 minutes. Trump then leaked the full interview himself.

The interview begins with Lesley Stahl asking Donald Trump, 'You're ok with some tough questions?' and Trump responding, 'No, I'm not.' 

Lesley Stahl repeatedly presses President Trump to share his health care plan, to explain the rise in COVID-19 cases, to justify why he called Dr. Anthony Fauci an 'idiot,' and more. At one point, Trump explicitly states that he hopes the Supreme Court 'ends' Obamacare.

In a hilarious power move the president didn’t take any chances of the interview being taken out of context so he released it three days before it was set to air.

He accused CBS journalist Lesley Stahl of orchestrating a “fake and biased” interview.

The two go back and forth throughout it, with Stahl insisting she “didn’t want this kind of interview”.

Transcript:
You and I are not very different from this flower. Just like this flower is unique, you are unique. All of us have something special that makes us as beautiful. Do you know what makes you special?
Now the answer to that can be a little difficult to find, because sometimes life has a cruel way of picking out your petals, breaking you in two and throwing you into the trash. Now when you’re broken, it’s very difficult to feel special.

Mr Contest Chair, my fellow flowers. I can remember the first time I broke. I was 17 years old. I had already flunked high school and managed to get myself arrested. Now, I wasn’t afraid of the cops, but there was one person I was very afraid of and that was my mama. Raise your hand if you have an emotional mother. Let me see. Put them all together you get my mama. I can hear her scream outside the police station; even the cops were afraid. She came up to me, held the iron bars, looked into my eyes and I saw a tear coming down her face.

Now I’ve seen my mama cry before, but mothers cry three types of tears: tears of joy, tears of sorrow and tears of shame. And when a son sees a mother cry tears of shame, that’s a life-changing moment. She looked at me and said, “Son, I want you to be a better man”. That night, when I drove home, my dad was waiting for me at home.

Now, my dad is a cool dad. Raise your hand if you have a cool dad. Put them all together you get my dad. My dad came up to me and said “Son, it’s OK. You flunked your exams. You already got arrested. That’s fine. You get that from your mother's side. I want you to start working immediately”. And I said, ‘OK.’

So my dad took me to meet one of his friends called Sam. Now, Sam was an accountant who had an accounting firm and had generously decided to make me his personal assistant, and there he was. He looked like a teddy bear, but this man was special. I looked at him and he looked at me, and then he said the most amazing thing. He said “Son, I see something in you, but I don’t know what it is. If you decide to work with me, I can help you find that something”. And I was like, wow!, that’s the first time in my whole life somebody has ever told they see something in me. And I started working for Sam.

And every day after work he used to tell me stories about the world, about history, about culture, about philosophy and it was much more interesting than what I learned in school. And I discovered I can dream and I started dreaming, ladies and gentlemen. After one year I went back into high school, completed my exams and went into college.

After successfully completing college, I found a great girl, but not a job. I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my life. Have you ever had that problem? And when you’re lost, it’s difficult to feel special. So I went back to my cool dad and I said: “Dad, I feel lost”.

He said, “You are like your mother.”

So my dad introduced me to this strange club that had a strange name, with strange people, talking.
On the first meeting, they told me to do something called a table topic. I aced it. But while I was speaking I see a strange man seated in the back row, humble, simple, the unfailing quality of kindness in his eyes. As soon as I finished, he walked up to me, looked me dead straight in the eye and said, “Son, I see something in you, but I don’t know what it is. If you come here twice a month maybe we can find that something.”

And ladies and gentlemen, I discovered I could speak and I love speaking and that led me to become a teacher. I know what it’s like to not have enough money in your bank account. I know what it’s like to worry when the bills start coming in. And sometimes in the middle of the night, I wake up my beautiful wife and ask her “Honey, why did you marry me?”

She says, “I saw something in you, but I still I don’t know what it is”

Ladies and gentlemen, today I’m a dreamer, I’m a speaker and I learned the unfailing quality of unconditional love from my wife.

I was broken and I’ve been broken, lost and broke many times in my life, but the people in my life were able to reach into the trash can and make me whole again. If it was up to me, I would have never been able to do that. And this is why if you have great people in your life, no matter how broke, how lost or how broken you become they can piece you back together.
Ladies and gentlemen, when I look at you I see something in you, but I don’t know what it is.
Over to you.

“Life is a struggle and the potential for failure is ever present, but those who live in fear of failure, or hardship, or embarrassment will never achieve their potential. Without pushing your limits, without occasionally sliding down the rope headfirst, without daring greatly, you will never know what is truly possible in your life.” 
― William H. McRaven

Stephen Colbert took over as host of The Late Show on Tuesday, Sept. 8, 2015. Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and best known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed “The Colbert Report,” which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time. Good luck, Bill!""",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jiMUoVjQ5uI/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-29 09:58:13.009530,Neutral,-1.5,"['PartisanLeft', 'LateNightTalkShow', 'PartisanLeft', 'LateNightTalkShow', 'LateNightTalkShow', 'PartisanLeft']",Far Left,False,2,OFPwDe22CoY

Stephen Colbert took over as host of The Late Show on Tuesday, Sept. 8, 2015. Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and best known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed “The Colbert Report,” which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time. Good luck, Bill!""",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jiMUoVjQ5uI/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-29 09:58:14.010408,Neutral,-1.5,"['PartisanLeft', 'LateNightTalkShow', 'PartisanLeft', 'LateNightTalkShow', 'LateNightTalkShow', 'PartisanLeft']",Far Left,False,5,aRQLU3IwNYs

Each week night, THE LATE LATE SHOW with JAMES CORDEN throws the ultimate late night after party with a mix of celebrity guests, edgy musical acts, games and sketches. Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.""",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ln3wAdRAim4/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-29 09:58:14.010536,Neutral,0.0,['None'],Neutral,False,5,aRQLU3IwNYs

Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed “The Colbert Report,” which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time. Good luck, Bill!""",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aRQLU3IwNYs/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-29 09:58:14.352563,Neutral,-1.5,"['PartisanLeft', 'LateNightTalkShow', 'PartisanLeft', 'LateNightTalkShow', 'LateNightTalkShow', 'PartisanLeft']",Far Left,True,6,QmPLGt5rd_k

Sacha Baron Cohen has a net worth of about $160 million, which makes him one of the richest comedians in Hollywood. Cohen’s hit film Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make benefit Glorious nation of Kazakhstan earned $262.6 million at the box office and turned Cohen into an instant star. However, Cohen reportedly only made $5 million for the film. The Borat sequel, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, was recently released on Amazon Prime Video. Amazon secured the streaming rights to the movie in a lucrative deal. Cohen earned as much as $30 million for both Bruno and the Dictator. Both movies were box office hits, but not as successful as Borat. Cohen has used his massive paydays to buy mansions and luxury cars. He owns an Audi A8 and numerous properties in California. He and his wife also own a stunning property in London. Cohen has donated both his time and money to charity. He has appeared in BBC’s comic relief and Seth Rogen’s Hilarity for Charity. Cohen donated $1 million to help Syrian refugees receive vaccinations and healthcare. Cohen has also donated to numerous charities like the Anti-defamation league, UNICEF, Charity Projects Entertainment Fund, Clothes Off Our Back, Declare Yourself, Project Hope, and Feeding America. Cohen’s movies have grossed over $3.5 billion at the box office, and he is one of the richest Britons in the world. Keep watching to see how Sacha Baron Cohen earns and spends all his money.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zyV-L2jy9Hc/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-29 09:58:25.381877,Neutral,0.0,['None'],Neutral,False,2,GUCy75CA3Aw

Sacha Baron Cohen has a net worth of about $160 million, which makes him one of the richest comedians in Hollywood. Cohen’s hit film Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make benefit Glorious nation of Kazakhstan earned $262.6 million at the box office and turned Cohen into an instant star. However, Cohen reportedly only made $5 million for the film. The Borat sequel, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, was recently released on Amazon Prime Video. Amazon secured the streaming rights to the movie in a lucrative deal. Cohen earned as much as $30 million for both Bruno and the Dictator. Both movies were box office hits, but not as successful as Borat. Cohen has used his massive paydays to buy mansions and luxury cars. He owns an Audi A8 and numerous properties in California. He and his wife also own a stunning property in London. Cohen has donated both his time and money to charity. He has appeared in BBC’s comic relief and Seth Rogen’s Hilarity for Charity. Cohen donated $1 million to help Syrian refugees receive vaccinations and healthcare. Cohen has also donated to numerous charities like the Anti-defamation league, UNICEF, Charity Projects Entertainment Fund, Clothes Off Our Back, Declare Yourself, Project Hope, and Feeding America. Cohen’s movies have grossed over $3.5 billion at the box office, and he is one of the richest Britons in the world. Keep watching to see how Sacha Baron Cohen earns and spends all his money.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zyV-L2jy9Hc/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-29 09:58:25.979538,Neutral,0.0,['None'],Neutral,False,4,GUCy75CA3Aw

Sacha Baron Cohen has a net worth of about $160 million, which makes him one of the richest comedians in Hollywood. Cohen’s hit film Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make benefit Glorious nation of Kazakhstan earned $262.6 million at the box office and turned Cohen into an instant star. However, Cohen reportedly only made $5 million for the film. The Borat sequel, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, was recently released on Amazon Prime Video. Amazon secured the streaming rights to the movie in a lucrative deal. Cohen earned as much as $30 million for both Bruno and the Dictator. Both movies were box office hits, but not as successful as Borat. Cohen has used his massive paydays to buy mansions and luxury cars. He owns an Audi A8 and numerous properties in California. He and his wife also own a stunning property in London. Cohen has donated both his time and money to charity. He has appeared in BBC’s comic relief and Seth Rogen’s Hilarity for Charity. Cohen donated $1 million to help Syrian refugees receive vaccinations and healthcare. Cohen has also donated to numerous charities like the Anti-defamation league, UNICEF, Charity Projects Entertainment Fund, Clothes Off Our Back, Declare Yourself, Project Hope, and Feeding America. Cohen’s movies have grossed over $3.5 billion at the box office, and he is one of the richest Britons in the world. Keep watching to see how Sacha Baron Cohen earns and spends all his money.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zyV-L2jy9Hc/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-29 09:58:26.728918,Neutral,0.0,['None'],Neutral,False,6,GUCy75CA3Aw

There was little Jeffrey Epstein wouldn’t do to satisfy his lust for young women and girls. It included spending millions of dollars masterminding a worldwide sex-trafficking operation. Countless innocent lives were destroyed. A year ago Epstein was arrested and a month later he died in custody. Investigators though refused to let this scandal go to the grave with him. Instead they shifted their attention to his high-profile friends. One of them is the Queen’s son, Prince Andrew, who continues to dodge requests from the FBI for an interview. But late this week there was a significant breakthrough in the case with the arrest of socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.  She’s accused of being Epstein’s right-hand woman and has been charged with multiple child sex offences. As Tara Brown reports, for the first time in a long time, the victims in this wicked saga are feeling relief rather than terror.

While Charles’ romance with a young Lady Diana Spencer (Emma Corrin) provides a much-needed fairytale to unite the British people, behind closed doors, the Royal family is becoming increasingly divided.

There was little Jeffrey Epstein wouldn’t do to satisfy his lust for young women and girls. It included spending millions of dollars masterminding a worldwide sex-trafficking operation. Countless innocent lives were destroyed. A year ago Epstein was arrested and a month later he died in custody. Investigators though refused to let this scandal go to the grave with him. Instead they shifted their attention to his high-profile friends. One of them is the Queen’s son, Prince Andrew, who continues to dodge requests from the FBI for an interview. But late this week there was a significant breakthrough in the case with the arrest of socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.  She’s accused of being Epstein’s right-hand woman and has been charged with multiple child sex offences. As Tara Brown reports, for the first time in a long time, the victims in this wicked saga are feeling relief rather than terror.

You have to shake your head in disbelief. How can these things happen? And in this particular case, how could he possibly get away with it for so long? It’s just unthinkable. A father who kept his daughter locked away in a secret chamber for 24 years. The poor girl was just eighteen when the horror began, and over the years, she had seven children. One died. Three were kept prisoner down in the cellar and inconceivably the others were adopted by the father and lived openly upstairs as his grandchildren. No wonder the family story stunned the world – and I must add a warning- what follows contains strong adult themes.

Divorces are often messy and costly affairs, but nothing compares to the one that currently entangles the royal family of Dubai. The Emirates’ ruler, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al-Maktoum, is pitted against his ex-wife, Princess Haya Bint Al-Hussain, who surprisingly at this point, holds the upper hand. In this billion-dollar battle a judge has ruled the Princess’ claims that the all-powerful Sheikh intimidated her with guns and threatened her with imprisonment are true. Other accusations against Sheikh Mohammed are so outrageous they’re difficult to believe, but as Tom Steinfort has been reporting for two years now, this royal ruler has form.

But its inconspicuousness was blown when police received an extraordinary 911 call from a 17-year-old girl. She claimed she and her 12 brothers and sisters, who ranged in age from 29 to 3, had for years been held against their will in the family home. She said they had been chained up, tortured and starved. Worst of all, she accused her parents of being responsible for the abuse. Following the emergency call, police and welfare authorities raided the home and rescued the children. They also arrested the parents, David and Louise Turpin. As Liam Bartlett reports, the mistreatment the 13 Turpin children endured is now considered to be one of the worst cases of child neglect and abuse in American history. But even more shockingly, he discovers the shameful family secret that started this nightmare.

Just as the world has never experienced a United States President quite like Donald Trump, it’s not seen a First Lady like Melania Trump either. Despite being one of the most photographed women on the planet, she remains virtually unknown. But wealthy New York socialite Stephanie Winston Wolkoff is now controversially trying to change all that. She says she was “besties”” with Melania for 15 years, and because of their friendship was not only appointed a senior adviser to the First Lady, she was also asked to organise Trump’s presidential inauguration. But two years ago the friendship between the two women soured. Stephanie claims she was the victim of an orchestrated political hit and was bitterly disappointed when Melania abandoned her. Many are calling it a despicable act of revenge, but Stephanie has now written a tell-all book about the First Lady and her secrets, and as she explains to Liam Bartlett in an exclusive interview, there are plenty of secrets to tell about Melania and the Donald.
