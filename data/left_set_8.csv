At a time when tensions are running high, CIS Executive Director Tom Switzer asked Has China Won? Our debate between John Mearsheimer and Kishore Mahbubani, two of the world’s leading foreign policy intellectuals. Covid-19 has greatly raised tensions between China and the West. Washington and its allies express outrage at the Communist regime’s opacity concerning the outbreak of the coronavirus. Meanwhile, fears are growing that a pandemic that began in the Chinese city of Wuhan may end by increasing Beijing’s international influence and power.

Kishore Mahbubani is author of Has China Won? The Chinese Challenge to American Primacy (just out, PublicAffairs) A former Singaporean ambassador to the United Nations (twice), he was the founding dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. He was a guest of CIS in September 2018.

John Mearsheimer is author of The Great Delusion: Liberal Dreams and International Realities (Yale University Press, 2019) and The Tragedy of Great Power Politics (Norton, 2014.) He is professor of Political Science at the University of Chicago. He was a guest of CIS in August 2019.

Tom Switzer, has written for the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Post, The Spectator, Financial Times, Foreign Affairs, The National Interest, The American Interest and The American Conservative. He has also appeared on CNN, CNBC, Bloomberg, Al Jazeera, Sky News, SBS, Seven, Nine, Ten and ABC radio and television. He hosts Between the Lines on the ABC's Radio National.

China is determined to restore the power and prestige it held before the 19th century, while the US is desperate to maintain its superpower status and image as the ideal society. The US and China have worked together in the past with mutual gain and respect, but a major geopolitical contest that was launched by the Trump administration could derail either county's plans for primacy. Join Ambassador Kishore Mahbubani for a discussion on why this geopolitical contest is a lose-lose situation for China and the US, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and global warming.

With many differences in political philosophy and diplomatic methods, they approach each other warily and communicate poorly. In ""Has China Won?: The Chinese Challenge to American Primacy,"" Ambassador Kishore Mahbubani, a former Singaporean diplomat and prolific scholar with access to policymakers in Beijing and Washington, has written a guide to the deep fault lines in the relationship, an assessment of the risks of confrontation, and an appraisal of the strengths and weaknesses, and superpower eccentricities, of the United States and China.

The National Committee held a virtual program on October 5, 2020 with Professor Kishore Mahbubani.

M8ayDH5DuJA,De Balie,UCWCIOLDsX8lY_CeKmV4k3NA,1523741813.0,Kishore Mahbubani - How Asia is rapidly overtaking The West - De Balie Invites,"The West has been at the forefront of world history for almost 200 years. But that era is over, says Kishore Mahbubani, one of Asia’s most renowned thinkers. China, India, and others in the “Rest” are rapidly overtaking the West, both at an economic and at an intellectual level. On April 14th, we will speak with the second thinker in the De Balie Invites series to find out: what is the cause of this switch? And how should the West respond?

“Americans and Europeans see it as self-evident that it is their responsibility to judge what is happening in the rest of the world. Based on the idea of moral superiority. This has been tolerated for more than 200 years, but listen: that time has passed. It’s about time to start listening to the rest of the world.” – Kishore Mahbubani (Trouw).

On April 14th, Mahbubani tells us about his newest book: Has the West Lost it? In this book, he writes about the decline of Western dominance, and the ignorance of the West about this fact. Mahbubani warns the West: it needs to adapt to this new reality, and it needs to do so quickly.

Mahbubani investigates in a refreshing manner the myths of Western dominance with the critical perspective of an outsider. Paul Scheffer will lead the conversation with Kishore this evening.

Kishore Mahbubani is a Singaporean academic and former diplomat. He is a Professor in the Practice of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore where he was formerly Dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. From 1971 to 2004, he served in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was Singapore's Permanent Representative to the United Nations. In that role, he served as President of the United Nations Security Council in January 2001 and May 2002.

Paul Scheffer (1954) is publicist and professor European studies at Tilburg University and Amsterdam University. He published several books and articles on Europe and the importance of boarders, culture and politics.

 N E D E R L A N D S : 

Het Westen stond de afgelopen 200 jaar aan kop in de wereldgeschiedenis, maar die tijd is voorbij. Volgens Kishore Mahbubani, een van de bekendste denkers van Azië, zijn o.a. China en India hard bezig om het Westen over te nemen, op zowel economisch als intellectueel vlak. Op 14 april spreken we met de tweede denker in de serie De Balie Invites, om uit te vinden wat de oorzaak is van deze verandering. Hoe moet het Westen reageren? 

‘Amerikanen en Europeanen zien het als vanzelfsprekend dat het hun verantwoordelijkheid is om te beoordelen wat er gebeurt in de rest van de wereld. Dat is gebaseerd op het idee dat het Westen moreel superieur zou zijn. Dit heeft de rest van de wereld de afgelopen 200 jaar getolereerd, maar luister: die tijd is voorbij. Het is tijd om naar de rest van de wereld te gaan luisteren.’ - Kishore Mahbubani (Trouw)

Op 14 april vertelt Mahbubani over zijn nieuwe boek: Is het Westen de weg kwijt?In dit boek schrijft hij over het einde van de Westerse dominantie, en dat het Westen dit maar niet onder ogen wil zien. Mahbubani waarschuwt het Westen: het zal zich aan moeten passen aan de nieuwe realiteit, en snel.
Mahbubani onderzoekt op een verfrissende manier de mythes van Westerse dominantie met het kritische perspectief van een buitenstaander.

Na zijn lezing gaat Kishore Mahbubani in gesprek met Paul Scheffer. 
 Yoeri Albercht zal het gesprek leiden.

LsY70_uIXNc,The Intercept,UCv002AUCZaPNwiADqwchijg,1519287696.0,Video: Glenn Greenwald and James Risen Debate the Trump/Russia Investigation,"JAMES RISEN AND GLENN GREENWALD have both won Pulitzer Prizes. They both have found themselves in the crosshairs of the U.S. government for their journalism. And they both write for The Intercept. But Jim and Glenn have taken very different approaches to covering the Trump/Russia story. In this one-hour special video edition of Intercepted, they go head-to-head in a debate. Glenn is one of the most high-profile critics of the official story bolstered by the U.S. intelligence community, the Democrats, and many media outlets, including some of this country’s most powerful papers and news channels. Jim battled both the Bush and Obama administrations — under threat of imprisonment — for refusing to name his sources in some of the most sensitive national security reporting of the modern era. Jim recently broke a key story on a secret NSA channel to Russia and his first column for The Intercept, about the Trump/Russia investigation, posed the question: Is Donald Trump a traitor?

The Intercept is an investigative nonprofit news organization dedicated to producing fearless, adversarial journalism. We believe journalism should bring transparency and accountability to powerful governmental and corporate institutions.

Morales later made clear that he viewed these events as a classic right-wing military coup of the kind that has plagued the continent for decades, explaining that he was removed from his position by force and then ultimately pressured by a police mutiny and military threats to flee his own country.

Morales went to Mexico, where he was granted political asylum, and lived under heavy security in Mexico City until being granted refugee status in Argentina. On December 3, I sat with Morales in Mexico City for an hourlong interview that was wide-ranging in scope: not only about the events that led to his removal and exile from Bolivia, but also broader trends in regional and global politics, as well as the role played by the U.S. in Latin America.

The results of this were far-reaching indeed, exposing human rights violations and covert operations. WikiLeaks and Assange have never been far from the spotlight in the intervening years, hitting the headlines again and again, especially with regards to Edward Snowden’s mass surveillance disclosures and Assange’s ongoing legal battles.

To coincide with the release of a definitive new book on the State Department cables, The WikiLeaks Files: The World According to US Empire, Assange will discuss the historical significance of that release and what the cables reveal about the United States as a 21st century superpower. Join Julian Assange, host Andrew Fowler and the Wheeler Centre for a riveting discussion on secrets, surveillance, imperialism and justice.

nR_28RIEGyw,Al Jazeera English,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,1583005087.0,On trial: Julian Assange and journalism | The Listening Post (Full),"On The Listening Post this week: To extradite or not to extradite: Julian Assange's trial and its consequences for journalism. Plus, prison journalism in the US.

On trial: Julian Assange and journalism 
We begin with the legal fate of Julian Assange. This past week saw the commencement of a court case that will determine whether Britain should extradite the WikiLeaks founder to the United States.

The US government has charged Assange for his part in the release of classified military documents - he's looking at a maximum prison sentence of 175 years.

Assange's advocates say he has little chance of getting a fair trial in the US and, if sent there, he could end up facing conditions amounting to torture.

It is a case against Julian Assange and, by implication, modern-day journalism.

Richard Gizbert speaks to producer Meenakshi Ravi about the ""Delhi Riots"" and the difficulties journalists are facing in trying to cover them.

America's Jailhouse Journalists
More than two million people live within the American prison system. That is roughly equivalent to the population of a city like Las Vegas, imprisoned across the country.

The stories of what really goes on inside are seldom heard. For journalists who have tried, access is the issue, with prison authorities usually controlling who gets in and what stories get out.

But some prisoners are determined to make this a beat of their own. The journalism they produce behind bars is of real value, both for audiences and the reporters involved.

The Listening Post's Flo Phillips on the ultimate inside story - prison journalism in the US.

Trump holds a midnight rally in Grand Rapids, MI. We're fact checking live for the last time before Election Day. This is Trump's fifth and final rally of the day. He's spent the day falsely claiming that voter fraud is rampant (it's so rare as to be almost nonexistent), that America is 'turning the corner' on COVID-19 (the virus is actually surging at a record rate), and that Joe Biden will mandate a national lockdown and quadruple everyone's taxes (Biden has never proposed such plans). If you have election questions, leave them in the Facebook comments or tweet them at @apiper13 and we'll try to answer as many as possible before Trump comes on.

If the 2020 US presidential election is close, the race could drag on in the courts and halls of Congress long after ballots are cast, says lawyer and political commentator Van Jones. Explaining why the customary concession speech is one of the most important safeguards for democracy, Jones exposes shocking legal loopholes that could enable a candidate to grab power even if they lose both the popular vote and the electoral college -- and shares what ordinary citizens can do if there's no peaceful transfer of power.

The TED Talks channel features the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less). Look for talks on Technology, Entertainment and Design -- plus science, business, global issues, the arts and more.

Watch more of our election coverage: http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

In the 2000 US presidential election, the Democratic candidate got half a million more votes than the Republican. The Democrat lost. Sixteen years later the same thing happened again. In the US, if you run for president, it does not actually matter how many people in the country vote for you. What matters instead is an arcane system for selecting America’s head of state called the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is the reason the US has something called “swing states,” and it’s the reason those places get to decide the future of the country. It’s the reason presidential candidates almost never campaign in the country’s biggest cities. And more recently, it’s also the reason that Republican candidates have been able to eke out victories in the presidential election without actually getting the most votes.

The Electoral College makes some Americans’ votes more powerful than others. In fact, that’s part of the reason we have it to begin with; in the country’s early years, the Electoral College helped give the votes of Southern Whites more weight than the votes of Northerners. The idea at its core, that certain votes simply matter more than others, is baked into the American tradition. In the 2020 election, it may decide the winner.

Further reading:
The historian Alexander Keyssar’s book “Why Do We Still Have the Electoral College?” takes you through the history and function of the Electoral College: https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674660151

For the bite-sized version of that history, Keyssar also wrote this piece in the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/opinion/electoral-college-racism-white-supremacy.html

The Times also had a great interactive feature on where the 2020 candidates actually spent money: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/17/us/politics/trump-biden-campaign-ad-spending.html

Pew has a breakdown of how democracies around the world elect their head of state, which really shows what an oddball the US is: https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/22/among-democracies-u-s-stands-out-in-how-it-chooses-its-head-of-state/

▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀

This is California, the Golden State and one of the largest economies in the world in its own right. 

If California was counted as a sovereign nation it would be the fifth-largest in the world by GDP, with a 3.2 trillion dollar gross state product putting it just behind Germany and just ahead of India. 

The state has a lot going for it, from the largest movie and technology centers in the world all the way to a surprisingly strong agricultural sector. 

All of this has meant that the residents of California are on average doing very well for themselves, and one look around the wealthy enclaves of las Angeles and san Francisco would back this up.

Despite all of this however, the state is going through a period of economic turbulence. 

The economic fallout of the coronavirus has hit the state’s economy particularly hard. 

Major industries like tourism and media creation have ground to a complete halt having widespread knock-on implications throughout the economy hitting smaller vendors who were once reliant on these industries.

This bump in the road however was by no means the total undoing of the state.

California’s metrics before 2020 looked very strong, with low unemployment, solid growth, and booming industries, but there were still cracks forming. 

The state is home to the largest population in the US but the industries that were truly driving wealth creation are famously bad at actually employing people. 

This had led to a sharp increase in social issues like homelessness and crime.

All of these problems that were bubbling away under the surface have now been massively accelerated, so much so that many economists have predicted that the sun might be setting on the setting on the sunshine state. 

It may sound like absurdist alarmism but it is a reality that shouldn’t be dismissed. 

Remember in previous decades there was another economic region in the US riding high on the new growth industry of the age. but these days Detroit is not exactly seen as the bastion of prosperity it once was. 

So could the same grim reality be in store for California? Well to answer this we need to look at a few key areas.

What made the state so prosperous before the 2020 downturn?

What were the underlying issues impacting the economy?

How will these issues be impacted by this decline?

A Short Bio on Rand Paul
Senator Rand Paul, M.D. is one of the nation’s leading advocates for liberty. Elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010, Dr. Paul has proven to be an outspoken champion for constitutional liberties and fiscal responsibility. As a fierce advocate against government overreach, Rand has fought tirelessly to return government to its limited, constitutional scope.

A devoted husband and father, Dr. Paul and his family live in Bowling Green, Kentucky, where Rand owned his own ophthalmology practice and performed eye surgery for 18 years. As a hard-working and dedicated physician--not a career politician--Rand Paul came to Washington to shake things up and to make a difference.

Dr. Paul has been married for 24 years to Kelley Ashby Paul of Russellville, Kentucky, and together, they have three sons: William, 21; Duncan, 18; and Robert, 15. He regularly volunteered to coach teams for each of his three sons in Little League baseball, soccer, and basketball. Rand and Kelley are both devout Christians and are active in their local church.

Rand is the third of five children born to Carol and Ron Paul. He grew up in Lake Jackson, Texas and attended Baylor University. He graduated from Duke Medical School in 1988. Dr. Paul completed a general surgery internship at Georgia Baptist Medical Center in Atlanta and completed his residency in ophthalmology at Duke University Medical Center. Upon completion of his training in 1993, Rand and Kelley moved to Bowling Green to start their family and begin his ophthalmology practice.

In 1995, Rand founded the Southern Kentucky Lions Eye Clinic, an organization that provides eye exams and surgery to needy families and individuals. Rand is a former president and 17-year member of Lions Clubs International, which is dedicated to preserving sight by providing eyeglasses and surgery to the less fortunate around the world. In recognition of his outstanding and sustained efforts to provide vision care to Kentuckians in need, Lions Clubs International has awarded Rand many of its highest commendations.

A large part of Rand's daily work as an ophthalmologist was dedicated to preserving the vision of our seniors. In 2002, The Twilight Wish Foundation recognized Rand for Outstanding Service and Commitment to Seniors. 

During his free time, Dr. Paul performs pro-bono eye surgeries for patients across Kentucky. Additionally, he provides free eye surgery to children from around the world through his participation in the Children of the Americas Program. Most recently, he traveled to Guatemala on a medical mission trip with the University of Utah's Moran Eye Center. During the week over 200 patients, many of them blind with cataracts had their vision restored by Dr. Paul.

Dr. Paul's entrance into politics is indicative of his life’s work as a surgeon: a desire to diagnose problems and provide practical solutions, whether it be in Bowling Green, Kentucky or Washington, D.C. 

Randal Howard ""Rand"" Paul (born January 7, 1963) is an American physician and politician from Kentucky. In office since 2011, Paul currently serves in the United States Senate as a member of the Republican Party. He is also a trained ophthalmologist and is the middle son of former U.S. Representative and physician Ron Paul of Texas.

Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Paul attended Baylor University and is a graduate of the Duke University School of Medicine. Paul began practicing ophthalmology in 1993 in Bowling Green, Kentucky and established his own clinic in December 2007.

Paul has been considered a supporter of the Tea Party movement, and a vocal critic of the Federal Reserve System. He has opposed NSA mass surveillance of Americans and supports reduced government spending and taxation. He describes himself as ""100% pro-life"" and has cosponsored legislation for the equal protection of the right to life from conception. Paul officially announced his candidacy for the 2016 U.S. presidential election on April 7, 2015.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BNUg7nWoBEk/hqdefault.jpg,2020-11-02 20:57:49.201400,Left,3.0,"['Libertarian', 'PartisanRight', 'AntiSJW']",Far Right,False,1,YdXUXdS0xSQ,3,Jo Jorgensen

In this video I discuss the viewpoints of the Libertarian Party on several different topics. We first look at an overview of the fundamental views of the party itself, including their founder, slogan, and their stance on government involvement. Then we talk about their stances in the following areas:

Taxes - 00:45
Economy - 1:35
Healthcare - 2:17
Civil Rights - 2:55
Education - 3:54
Immigration - 4:26

Although there are many other views of the Libertarian Party, this is mean to give a brief and informative introduction to the Libertarian Party's platform.

He regularly volunteered to coach teams for each of his three sons in Little League baseball, soccer, and basketball. Rand and Kelley are both devout Christians and are active in their local church.

Rand is the third of five children born to Carol and Ron Paul. He grew up in Lake Jackson, Texas and attended Baylor University. He graduated from Duke Medical School in 1988. Dr. Paul completed a general surgery internship at Georgia Baptist Medical Center in Atlanta and completed his residency in ophthalmology at Duke University Medical Center. Upon completion of his training in 1993, Rand and Kelley moved to Bowling Green to start their family and begin his ophthalmology practice.

In 1995, Rand founded the Southern Kentucky Lions Eye Clinic, an organization that provides eye exams and surgery to needy families and individuals. Rand is a former president and 17-year member of Lions Clubs International, which is dedicated to preserving sight by providing eyeglasses and surgery to the less fortunate around the world. In recognition of his outstanding and sustained efforts to provide vision care to Kentuckians in need, Lions Clubs International has awarded Rand many of its highest commendations.

A large part of Rand's daily work as an ophthalmologist was dedicated to preserving the vision of our seniors. In 2002, The Twilight Wish Foundation recognized Rand for Outstanding Service and Commitment to Seniors. 

During his free time, Dr. Paul performs pro-bono eye surgeries for patients across Kentucky. Additionally, he provides free eye surgery to children from around the world through his participation in the Children of the Americas Program. Most recently, he traveled to Guatemala on a medical mission trip with the University of Utah's Moran Eye Center. During the week over 200 patients, many of them blind with cataracts had their vision restored by Dr. Paul.

Dr. Paul's entrance into politics is indicative of his life’s work as a surgeon: a desire to diagnose problems and provide practical solutions, whether it be in Bowling Green, Kentucky or Washington, D.C. 

Randal Howard ""Rand"" Paul (born January 7, 1963) is an American physician and politician from Kentucky. In office since 2011, Paul currently serves in the United States Senate as a member of the Republican Party. He is also a trained ophthalmologist and is the middle son of former U.S. Representative and physician Ron Paul of Texas.

Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Paul attended Baylor University and is a graduate of the Duke University School of Medicine. Paul began practicing ophthalmology in 1993 in Bowling Green, Kentucky and established his own clinic in December 2007.

Paul has been considered a supporter of the Tea Party movement, and a vocal critic of the Federal Reserve System. He has opposed NSA mass surveillance of Americans and supports reduced government spending and taxation. He describes himself as ""100% pro-life"" and has cosponsored legislation for the equal protection of the right to life from conception. Paul officially announced his candidacy for the 2016 U.S. presidential election on April 7, 2015.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BNUg7nWoBEk/hqdefault.jpg,2020-11-02 20:57:49.701524,Left,3.0,"['Libertarian', 'PartisanRight', 'AntiSJW']",Far Right,False,2,jd8odE1zebM,3,Jo Jorgensen

How does a Libertarian president work with congress to move the country to more libertarian ideals, and what policies do you think you could find common ground on with either side?

With replacing social security with your 6.2 proposal from cato which was rated by the SSA to return the program to solvency, while making this change how do we protect those that are currently dependent on ss retirement and especially disability?

How do we reduce the cost of healthcare across the board while upholding standards of care for patients?

During your acceptance speech you spoke on the story of Libba Bray, how do we as libertarians protect the rights of the lgbtq+ community, a common objection to privatization of healthcare would be cheaper healthcare but does that do any good if you can be refused service for not being gender-conforming especially in small communities with limited market choice? 

The younger generation faces fears of never being able to afford a home let alone rent in this country, how can we make housing more affordable?

Tuition costs are skyrocketing and are likely to continue to do so, how do we reduce the cost of education?
 
Following up on removing the department of education one common objection to removing the DOE is what would prevent a teacher from teaching “bad things” I would argue the same thing that stops them now and its not the DOE..but hearing your thoughts on it would answer many questions. 

What steps will you take to defend the second amendment?

Do you support removing the automobile import ban on cars less than 25 years old?

What is your favorite whiskey?

Would you end breed specific legislation?

What can we do to help you win this election? To stay up to date on the latest libertarian candidates news visit our website

The US Senate is supposed to pass laws. But today, it’s broken. And it’s broken because of something called the filibuster, which has been part of Senate tradition for over 200 years. But the filibuster came into being by accident. And today, some politicians are suggesting we should get rid of it entirely.

PaxVCsnox_4,TED-Ed,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA,1591237550.0,Which voting system is the best? - Alex Gendler,"Dive into four different voting systems: plurality, instant runoff, tactical, and the Condorcet method, and find out which is fairest. 

--

Imagine we want to build a new space port at one of four recently settled Martian bases, and are holding a vote to choose its location. Of the 100 colonists on Mars, 42 live on West Base, 26 on North Base, 15 on South Base, and 17 on East Base. Assuming that everyone wants the port to be closest to their home base, what is the fairest way to conduct the vote? Alex Gendler digs into voting systems.

mICxKmCjF-4,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,1540846446.0,Admit it. Republicans have broken politics.,"Neither party is perfect, but Republicans in Congress have been drifting towards political extremism since long before Trump, and they’re making it impossible for Congress to work the way it’s supposed to.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Over the past few decades, both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have moved away from the center. But the Republican Party has moved towards the extreme much more quickly -- a trend that political scientists’ call “asymmetrical polarization.”

That asymmetry poses a major obstacle in American politics. As Republicans have become more ideological, they’ve also become less willing to work with Democrats: filibustering Democratic legislation, refusing to consider Democratic appointees, and even shutting down the government in order to force Democrats to give in to their demands. 

Democrats have responded in turn, becoming more obstructionist as Republican demands become more extreme. 

And that’s made it really easy for media outlets to blame “both sides” for political gridlock. As political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein explain in their book “It’s Even Worse Than It Looks,” journalists feel a pressure to remain neutral when covering big political fights. So politics coverage has been dominated by the myth that both parties are equally to blame for the gridlock in DC. 

But they’re not. And the only way to stop Republicans in Congress from continuing their drift towards the extreme is to be brutally honest about who’s responsible for breaking our politics.

ajavsMbCapY,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,1604127786.0,"The Electoral College, explained","Why some Americans’ votes count more than others.

Watch more of our election coverage: http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

In the 2000 US presidential election, the Democratic candidate got half a million more votes than the Republican. The Democrat lost. Sixteen years later the same thing happened again. In the US, if you run for president, it does not actually matter how many people in the country vote for you. What matters instead is an arcane system for selecting America’s head of state called the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is the reason the US has something called “swing states,” and it’s the reason those places get to decide the future of the country. It’s the reason presidential candidates almost never campaign in the country’s biggest cities. And more recently, it’s also the reason that Republican candidates have been able to eke out victories in the presidential election without actually getting the most votes.

The Electoral College makes some Americans’ votes more powerful than others. In fact, that’s part of the reason we have it to begin with; in the country’s early years, the Electoral College helped give the votes of Southern Whites more weight than the votes of Northerners. The idea at its core, that certain votes simply matter more than others, is baked into the American tradition. In the 2020 election, it may decide the winner.

Watch more 2020 US election explainers at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

For 150 years, the US avoided formal alliances. It occasionally went to war -- fighting the War of 1812, the Spanish-American War, and World War I -- but did so without entangling itself in promises to other countries. Then, after World War II, it abruptly changed course, and began to build a network of alliances unlike anything that had come before.

Over the next few decades, the US used those alliances to keep countries around the world close, and to fight Soviet expansion, by making a promise that it would go to war if any of its allies were ever attacked. After the Soviet Union fell, the initial purpose of those alliances was gone, but the US recommitted to them, signaling again and again that the central promise of those relationships was still in effect. It kept doing so for the next 25 years.

Then the US elected a leader who took America’s global relationships in a new direction. President Trump was skeptical that America’s network of alliances was still beneficial to the US. He began to distance the US from those alliances, raising doubts about whether America would actually follow through on the promise at the core of them if provoked. Some allies moved closer to Russia or China, both of whom had attempted to undermine America’s alliances. 

Today, the future of those alliances is on the ballot in the US. One of the major presidential candidates in the 2020 election wants to return the US to its former status with its allies; the other finds its decades-old alliances costly and cumbersome. The world is waiting to see which vision Americans prefer.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

On June 26, 2020, the US House of Representatives voted to make America’s capital city, Washington, DC, the country’s 51st state. It was a historic vote, and the closest the country has come to adding a new state in over 60 years. But it was also, for the time being, completely symbolic. Because at least in 2020, DC has no chance of actually becoming a state.

That June 26 vote was almost entirely along party lines; Democrats mostly voted in favor of DC statehood, and Republicans against it. That’s because making DC a state would give the Democrats additional seats in Congress, potentially affecting the balance of power between the parties. It’s why President Trump and the Republican-controlled Senate have both promised to strike down any bid for DC statehood. And in fact, statehood in the US has always been a political issue. In the past, the US has often added states in pairs to preserve the political balance. Admitting a new state on its own has happened, but it’s unusual.

But the case for DC statehood is strong: The city has a similar population to several states, its hundreds of thousands of residents lack any say in national lawmaking, and its local government is uniquely vulnerable to being strong-armed by Congress and the federal government. Simply put, the laws that created the district did not anticipate that it would one day be a major city. And while in 1993, the last time Congress voted on DC statehood, the Democratic-controlled House failed to pass it, today’s Democratic Party is increasingly on board with it. If 2020’s election puts the Democrats in full control of the federal government, America might actually get its 51st state.

Today’s Republican Party opposes big government. It’s culturally conservative. Its demographic support is strongest among white voters, and it usually dominates elections in the South. And its 2016 presidential nominee has been heavily criticized for inciting racial tensions.

But things weren’t always this way. 

Over the past 160 or so years, the party has undergone a remarkable transformation from the party of Abraham Lincoln… to the party of Donald Trump.

Correction at 7:23: Cynthia's ancestors lived in Wilmington, not her descendants.

In November 1898, in Wilmington, North Carolina, a mob of 2,000 white men expelled black and white political leaders, destroyed the property of the city’s black residents, and killed dozens--if not hundreds--of people. How did such a turn of events change the course of the city? For decades, the story of this violence was buried, while the perpetrators were cast as heroes. Yet its impacts resonate across the state to this day.

In the new Vox series Missing Chapter, Vox Senior Producer Ranjani Chakraborty revisits underreported and often overlooked moments from the past to give context to the present. Join her as she covers the histories that are often left out of our textbooks. Our first season tackles stories of racial injustice, political conflicts, even the hidden history of US medical experimentation.

Putin's Kleptocracy: Who Owns Russia? By Karen Dawisha

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Vladimir Putin has been ruling Russia since 1999. In that time he has shaped the country into an authoritarian and militaristic society. The Soviet Union dissolved into 15 new countries, including the new Russian Federation. In Putin’s eyes, Russia had just lost 2 million square miles of territory. But Putin’s regime has also developed and fostered the most effect cyber hacker army in the world and he’s used it to wreak havoc in the West. But the election of Donald Trump brings new hope for the Putin vision. Trump’s rhetoric has been notably soft on Russia. He could lift sanctions and weaken NATO, potentially freeing up space for Putin’s Russia to become a dominant power once again.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

The United Daughters of the Confederacy was a significant leader of the “Lost Cause,” an intellectual movement that revised history to look more favorably on the South after the American Civil War. They were women from elite antebellum families that used their social and political clout to fundraise and pressure local governments to erect monuments that memorialized Confederate heroes. They also formed textbook review committees that monitored what Southern schoolchildren learned about the war. Their influential work with children created a lasting memory of the Confederate cause, and those generations grew up to be the segregationists of the Jim Crow Era in the South.

Note: At 5:05, a previous version of the video mistakenly covered Kentucky as a former Confederate state on the map. The error has been corrected.

mICxKmCjF-4,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,1540846446.0,Admit it. Republicans have broken politics.,"Neither party is perfect, but Republicans in Congress have been drifting towards political extremism since long before Trump, and they’re making it impossible for Congress to work the way it’s supposed to.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Over the past few decades, both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have moved away from the center. But the Republican Party has moved towards the extreme much more quickly -- a trend that political scientists’ call “asymmetrical polarization.”

That asymmetry poses a major obstacle in American politics. As Republicans have become more ideological, they’ve also become less willing to work with Democrats: filibustering Democratic legislation, refusing to consider Democratic appointees, and even shutting down the government in order to force Democrats to give in to their demands. 

Democrats have responded in turn, becoming more obstructionist as Republican demands become more extreme. 

And that’s made it really easy for media outlets to blame “both sides” for political gridlock. As political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein explain in their book “It’s Even Worse Than It Looks,” journalists feel a pressure to remain neutral when covering big political fights. So politics coverage has been dominated by the myth that both parties are equally to blame for the gridlock in DC. 

But they’re not. And the only way to stop Republicans in Congress from continuing their drift towards the extreme is to be brutally honest about who’s responsible for breaking our politics.

Follow Strikethrough on Facebook! https://www.facebook.com/CarlosMazaVox/

After eight years of attacking President Obama, Fox has happily adapted to its new role as a guard dog for the Trump administration. But the relationship between Fox and Trump is less of a romance and more of a hostage situation. Rupert Murdoch, Executive Chairman of News Corp (which owns Fox News), was a vocal critic of Trump during the 2016 campaign. He criticized Trump’s position on immigration, accused Trump of “embarrassing” the country, and was once described as “the billionaire Donald Trump can’t win over.”
So what explains Murdoch’s change of heart? Why is one of Trump’s most influential critics allowing his network to turn into a Trump PR channel?

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

One of the biggest myths about the Israel-Palestine conflict is that it's been going on for centuries, that this is all about ancient religious hatreds.

In fact, while religion is involved, the conflict is mostly about two groups of people who claim the same land. And it really only goes back about a century, to the early 1900s. At its heart, it is a conflict between two self-determination movements — the Jewish Zionist project and the Palestinian nationalist project — that lay claim to the same territory.

Putin's Kleptocracy: Who Owns Russia? By Karen Dawisha

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Vladimir Putin has been ruling Russia since 1999. In that time he has shaped the country into an authoritarian and militaristic society. The Soviet Union dissolved into 15 new countries, including the new Russian Federation. In Putin’s eyes, Russia had just lost 2 million square miles of territory. But Putin’s regime has also developed and fostered the most effect cyber hacker army in the world and he’s used it to wreak havoc in the West. But the election of Donald Trump brings new hope for the Putin vision. Trump’s rhetoric has been notably soft on Russia. He could lift sanctions and weaken NATO, potentially freeing up space for Putin’s Russia to become a dominant power once again.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Fox News constantly accuses other news organizations of having a liberal bias, claiming networks like CNN and MSNBC are in bed with the Democratic Party. But over the past few years, major Fox personalities ike Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, and Jeanine Pirro have become more open about their support for the Republican Party -- appearing at GOP campaign events, speaking at Republican fundraisers, and even explicitly endorsing Republican candidates on air. Republican candidates have noticed, and have begun using friendly coverage on Fox as part of their campaign strategies. 

Fox News is transforming from a right-wing news network into a full-on Republican campaign operation. Pretty soon, people like Sean Hannity won’t have to leave their studio sets to be on the campaign trail.

Today’s Republican Party opposes big government. It’s culturally conservative. Its demographic support is strongest among white voters, and it usually dominates elections in the South. And its 2016 presidential nominee has been heavily criticized for inciting racial tensions.

But things weren’t always this way. 

Over the past 160 or so years, the party has undergone a remarkable transformation from the party of Abraham Lincoln… to the party of Donald Trump.

“Don’t normalize this” has become a kind of rallying cry during President Trump’s first year in office -- a reminder to not get too acclimated to Trump’s norm-breaking and erratic behavior. 
But the real danger of the Trump presidency might have less to do with Trump’s abnormality and more to do with how “normal” he makes other Republicans look by comparison. And the concept of the “Overton Window” helps explain why our politics and media might be warped long after Trump’s presidency comes to an end.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_v-hzc6blGI/hqdefault.jpg,2020-11-02 20:58:02.812466,Left,-1.3333333333333333,"['PartisanLeft', 'SocialJustice', 'MissingLinkMedia', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanLeft', 'MissingLinkMedia', 'SocialJustice', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanLeft', 'SocialJustice', 'MissingLinkMedia', 'Mainstream News']",Left,False,3,mICxKmCjF-4,4,Democratic Party

The Supreme Court will decide whether Electoral College voters have a constitutional right to cast ballots for candidates who didn’t win their state’s popular vote, the justices announced in an order on Friday.

The justices said they will hear two cases brought by Electoral College voters in Washington state and Colorado who refused to vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016 despite her wins in those states.

Like most states, Washington and Colorado require their electors to follow the will of their states’ voters. But those laws are now being challenged by Electoral College voters who argue that such laws are unconstitutional.

A decision in the matter is expected by the end of June, ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November. The cases are the latest in a string of high-profile disputes the top court is expected to resolve in a contentious election year.

Historically, the faithfulness of Electoral College voters has largely been a formality. In 2016, 10 out of the total 538 electors attempted to cast ballots out of line with their state’s popular vote. But attorneys on both sides of the issue urged the top court to resolve the constitutional question before a crisis emerges.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been called the most powerful woman in the world, the liberal West's last defender, and the de facto leader of Europe. But 19 years after entering politics, she has announced she won't be running for a fifth term as chancellor and will be stepping away from politics. Her announcement comes at a pivotal time when nationalism is on the rise in Europe and the continent is still reeling from the 2015 migrant crisis. So what does Merkel stepping down mean for the future of Germany — and for the European Union?

After prohibition — the total ban on alcohol — many states established a minimum legal drinking age of 21. But that began to change after the voting age was lowered to 18. Many states followed by lowering their drinking ages, which changed the landscape for the entire country.

By the 1980s, this unusual patchwork of drinking ages started to be seen as a problem, especially by activist organizations like MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Drivers) and RID (Remove Intoxicated Drivers). They lobbied for a 21-year-old minimum legal drinking age, and President Ronald Reagan supported the cause. His mechanism for enabling a national law? Threatening to withhold Federal Highway funding to states that didn’t comply.

It was an unpredictable strategy for an official typically hesitant to use federal power over the states, and the practice was eventually challenged in the Supreme Court, where it was upheld.

Beyond the political clash, it’s a look at how roads shape policy.

Correction at 7:23: Cynthia's ancestors lived in Wilmington, not her descendants.

In November 1898, in Wilmington, North Carolina, a mob of 2,000 white men expelled black and white political leaders, destroyed the property of the city’s black residents, and killed dozens--if not hundreds--of people. How did such a turn of events change the course of the city? For decades, the story of this violence was buried, while the perpetrators were cast as heroes. Yet its impacts resonate across the state to this day.

In the new Vox series Missing Chapter, Vox Senior Producer Ranjani Chakraborty revisits underreported and often overlooked moments from the past to give context to the present. Join her as she covers the histories that are often left out of our textbooks. Our first season tackles stories of racial injustice, political conflicts, even the hidden history of US medical experimentation.

To learn more, listen to this episode of Today Explained, a daily podcast from Vox: http://art19.com/shows/today-explained/episodes/f1c11e8e-1637-4e2b-8261-ab8086c927ce

Rudy Giuliani started his career as a superstar prosecutor and a crime-fighting mayor. Then he led New York City back from the attacks of September 11th, and it made him a beloved national figure. But today's Giuliani is something different: He's the guy willing to say anything to defend Donald Trump on TV, a central figure in the scandal that got the president impeached, and he's under investigation by the US attorney's office he once led. How did Rudy Giuliani get here?

The White House press conference has always been a frustrating spectacle, with reporters trying to pry information from government officials who do everything in their power to avoid sharing too much information. But these press conferences are typically appreciated because of their symbolic value -- they reaffirm the democratic idea that the government must answer to the people.

That symbolic value has changed under Trump, who uses press conferences to stage high profile fights with the press and mobilize his base.

mICxKmCjF-4,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,1540846446.0,Admit it. Republicans have broken politics.,"Neither party is perfect, but Republicans in Congress have been drifting towards political extremism since long before Trump, and they’re making it impossible for Congress to work the way it’s supposed to.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Over the past few decades, both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have moved away from the center. But the Republican Party has moved towards the extreme much more quickly -- a trend that political scientists’ call “asymmetrical polarization.”

That asymmetry poses a major obstacle in American politics. As Republicans have become more ideological, they’ve also become less willing to work with Democrats: filibustering Democratic legislation, refusing to consider Democratic appointees, and even shutting down the government in order to force Democrats to give in to their demands. 

Democrats have responded in turn, becoming more obstructionist as Republican demands become more extreme. 

And that’s made it really easy for media outlets to blame “both sides” for political gridlock. As political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein explain in their book “It’s Even Worse Than It Looks,” journalists feel a pressure to remain neutral when covering big political fights. So politics coverage has been dominated by the myth that both parties are equally to blame for the gridlock in DC. 

But they’re not. And the only way to stop Republicans in Congress from continuing their drift towards the extreme is to be brutally honest about who’s responsible for breaking our politics.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

At first glance, US President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin seem to have wildly different communication styles. But what they share is a tendency to repeat big, obvious lies -- a tactic researchers have dubbed the “firehose of falsehood.” Whether it’s lying about Russian troops in Crimea or falsely claiming millions of people voted illegally during the 2016 election, both leaders demonstrate a kind of shamelessness when it comes to telling and retelling big lies. And that’s because firehosing isn’t actually about persuasion. It’s about power.

Read more about the hack gap on Vox.com: https://www.vox.com/2018/10/23/18004478/hack-gap-explained

We tend to assume that if a story is being covered by major news networks, it’s because journalists have decided that the story is important. But thanks to Fox News, that’s not always true. 

The network was specifically created to generate scandals that would hurt Democrats and help Republicans. And because most major networks pay attention to what happens in conservative media, those pseudoscandals end up creeping into mainstream coverage. 

The result is a media ecosystem that advantages Republicans by paying disproportionate attention to right-wing talking points.

Tucker Carlson has branded himself as a populist, condemning the “liberal elite” that he argues makes up the American “ruling class.” It’s a good shtick, and it’s helped him stand out from other Fox News hosts. But while Tucker decries the “elite” on his show, he regularly ignores major stories of Republican economic policies that harm the working class, choosing instead to focus on bogus culture war stories.

That isn’t an accident. Carlson’s show is meant to distract Fox News viewers from Republican economics, channeling their frustration and anger at groups that don’t deserve it. That kind of misdirection produces what Marxist theorists call “false consciousness”: when workers are tricked into accepting their own exploitation.

And the more Fox convinces Republican voters to shrug off major Trump scandals, the less likely it becomes that Congressional Republicans will feel the need to keep the president’s actions in check.
