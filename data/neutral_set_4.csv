Just as the world has never experienced a United States President quite like Donald Trump, it’s not seen a First Lady like Melania Trump either. Despite being one of the most photographed women on the planet, she remains virtually unknown. But wealthy New York socialite Stephanie Winston Wolkoff is now controversially trying to change all that. She says she was “besties”” with Melania for 15 years, and because of their friendship was not only appointed a senior adviser to the First Lady, she was also asked to organise Trump’s presidential inauguration. But two years ago the friendship between the two women soured. Stephanie claims she was the victim of an orchestrated political hit and was bitterly disappointed when Melania abandoned her. Many are calling it a despicable act of revenge, but Stephanie has now written a tell-all book about the First Lady and her secrets, and as she explains to Liam Bartlett in an exclusive interview, there are plenty of secrets to tell about Melania and the Donald.

Planet Earth has existed for around 4.5 billion years, much longer than humans have been around and it’s not always looked the way it does now. The Earth is dynamic, and constantly changing and its landmasses shifting and colliding over millions of years… and have so far left us with the 7 continents we see today. You might think that the planet is done evolving, but the continents are still moving around the planet, just as fast or maybe even faster than predicted. In fact, huge cracks have opened in the Earth’s crust overnight before our very eyes, and even the formation of a new ocean is happening right this moment. This is what it’s like living on a geologically active planet…

There was a time in Earth’s history that was so stable, geologists once called it the Boring Billion. But the fact is, this period was anything but boring. In fact, it set the stage for our modern version of plate tectonics - and probably for the rise of life as we know it.

There was little Jeffrey Epstein wouldn’t do to satisfy his lust for young women and girls. It included spending millions of dollars masterminding a worldwide sex-trafficking operation. Countless innocent lives were destroyed. A year ago Epstein was arrested and a month later he died in custody. Investigators though refused to let this scandal go to the grave with him. Instead they shifted their attention to his high-profile friends. One of them is the Queen’s son, Prince Andrew, who continues to dodge requests from the FBI for an interview. But late this week there was a significant breakthrough in the case with the arrest of socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.  She’s accused of being Epstein’s right-hand woman and has been charged with multiple child sex offences. As Tara Brown reports, for the first time in a long time, the victims in this wicked saga are feeling relief rather than terror.

Just who is hoodwinking who?

Well yes, if you believe an increasing number of increasingly angry people who are convinced coronavirus is nothing more than a sinister plot to control their lives. But what do these conspiracy theorists know that we don’t, and why do so many people listen to them? Liz Hayes speaks with Australians, including the controversial celebrity Pete Evans, who are sick of being told what to do by the government and other authorities.

It’s a Hollywood drama like the world has never seen. With an A-list cast, it’s full of intrigue and fiery dialogue, and topped off with lashings of sex and drugs. There is even a pivotal scene set right here in Australia, starring politician Barnaby Joyce. But this production isn’t playing at any theatre. Centre stage is a London court where actor Johnny Depp is suing an English tabloid for calling him a wife beater. As Tom Steinfort reveals, no one is going to win an Oscar, but Depp and his one-time bride, actress Amber Heard, have been putting on the performance of their lives, airing every sordid detail of their bizarre and doomed marriage.

There’s no better feeling than being in love. And there are few worse feelings than love gone wrong. When it happens it can be bizarre, and at times incredibly cruel. Former couple, rugby league star Josh Reynolds and Instagram lingerie model Arabella Del Busso, can certainly attest to that. As is often the way with modern romances, their attraction to each other was as instant as it was passionate. But their relationship ended as a very public police matter. Then the story got even stranger. Claims of fake pregnancies, fake cancers, fake funerals and domestic violence caused more scandalous headlines. Many people assumed Josh was just another footballer behaving badly until it emerged that Arabella was not necessarily the victim she said she was. In a special edition of 60 MINUTES, Tom Steinfort speaks to the warring parties as he explains this twisted tale of doomed romance.

In September 2007, 20-year-old Matt vanished after a fight with his older partner, Michael Atkins. Atkins denied having any involvement in the young man's disappearance, and sensationally claimed Matt was still alive. But Mark and Faye always suspected Atkins was a cruel liar, and was in fact responsible for their son's death. However, to expose his deceit, and most importantly to find Matt's body, the Levesons had to agree to a horrible deal with the devil. It meant Atkins received immunity from prosecution - a free ""stay out of jail"" card - for revealing where he buried Matt. At the same time Atkins also gave police his explanation of how Matt died from a drug overdose. Mark and Faye say it's more lies, but in a major 60 MINUTES investigation, Tara Brown uncovers yet another surprising twist in this long-running case (2017).

Australians have no sympathy for Borce Ristevski. He’s one of the most despised men in the country. In June 2016 he killed his wife of 27 years, Karen, and callously dumped her body in bushland outside Melbourne. But for three years he tried to dupe everyone, the police and the public, into believing he had nothing to do with the crime. He wanted us to think he was as shocked as anyone by Karen’s sudden disappearance from the family home, and grief-stricken when her remains were found in February 2017. 

However, there was always something less than convincing about his sorrow and it inevitably led to whispers of suspicion, which as time went on grew and grew. Last year Borce Ristevski finally admitted he was a killer. To avoid a murder trial he pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of his wife. But this story doesn’t end with Ristevski’s imprisonment because another life has also been destroyed. Sarah Ristevski is the couple’s only child. Until this terrible ordeal she treasured her idyllic upbringing, but now she’s confronting an agonising dilemma: how to make sense of the fact the mother she loved was killed by the father she loved – and still loves! 24-year-old Sarah had never spoken publicly about her parents until she sat down with Liz Hayes for the most extraordinary and emotional interview of 2020.

But the manner of her death still grips people with horror. The cunning dingo entered the tent where tiny Azaria was sleeping and brazenly snatched her away. In fact what the dingo did was so improbable many thought it was impossible. But 40 years on, on Queensland’s Fraser Island, there was a near identical attack. As Charles Wooley reveals in this 60 MINUTES exclusive, a dingo grabbed a 14-month-old baby boy from inside the camper trailer where he was sleeping. As the child was being carried away in the jaws of the wild animal, his crying woke his parents who, in the nick of time, were able to rescue their son as he was being dragged away into the bush.

But in 2017, at the height of his success, the veteran actor received a surprising – and unwelcome – blast from the past. A woman he’d known decades before, someone he thought of then as a friend, suddenly claimed he was a monster in real life. She said one night back in 1976, Jarratt raped her. With that damning allegation his career and reputation instantly disintegrated. Jarratt vehemently denied the accusation but was charged by police. His life went on hold as he waited for the case to be heard in court and his fate determined by the deliberations of a jury. But while he contemplated the possibility of a very bleak future, Jarratt made an incredible decision. He agreed to let 60 MINUTES record every moment of the fight to clear his name. For this extraordinarily revealing story, reporter Tara Brown spent months with John Jarratt, his family and legal team, in the lead-up to and during the most tumultuous time of his life.

It’s a Hollywood drama like the world has never seen. With an A-list cast, it’s full of intrigue and fiery dialogue, and topped off with lashings of sex and drugs. There is even a pivotal scene set right here in Australia, starring politician Barnaby Joyce. But this production isn’t playing at any theatre. Centre stage is a London court where actor Johnny Depp is suing an English tabloid for calling him a wife beater. As Tom Steinfort reveals, no one is going to win an Oscar, but Depp and his one-time bride, actress Amber Heard, have been putting on the performance of their lives, airing every sordid detail of their bizarre and doomed marriage.
