One of the greatest perks of being president is not having to deal with traffic every day. For one thing, you've got drivers who can take you anywhere you need to go, and for another, the Secret Service can block off traffic for you to ensure your security. It's no fun for anyone else on the road, but hey, you're the president, and you have important things to do.

There is a downside, though. Once a president's term is over, they can never drive a car on an open road again. The reason is because of the lifetime Secret Service detail that all ex-presidents get. After all, one of the least safe places you can be is on the road, and that's just under normal circumstances. Add in that ex-presidents are always a target, and things get even hairier. So, to ensure their safety, they're not allowed to hit the road.

As George W. Bush explained to Jay Leno, he's only allowed to drive on his own private property, far from any reckless drivers or people who wish him harm. He must be driven everywhere by Secret Service agents trained in ""evasive and defensive driving maneuvers."" The rule was instituted after John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963. Lyndon B. Johnson was, to date, the last president to drive on public roads.

If the 2020 US presidential election is close, the race could drag on in the courts and halls of Congress long after ballots are cast, says lawyer and political commentator Van Jones. Explaining why the customary concession speech is one of the most important safeguards for democracy, Jones exposes shocking legal loopholes that could enable a candidate to grab power even if they lose both the popular vote and the electoral college -- and shares what ordinary citizens can do if there's no peaceful transfer of power.

KpljCyzyBsQ,Bloomberg Quicktake: Now,UChirEOpgFCupRAk5etXqPaA,1605676013.0,LIVE: Georgia Election Officials Give Briefing as Trump Attacks Mail-In Voting,"(Nov. 17) The Republican secretary of state in Georgia said he believes that President Donald Trump cost himself votes with his campaign to undermine mail-in voting.

Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said Trump’s frequent and unsubstantiated accusations of mail-in voting fraud likely contributed to 24,500 people who voted in the state’s Republican primary not voting in the Nov. 3 election -- possibly accounting for President-elect Joe Biden’s 14,000-vote advantage in the state.

“In effect, what you’re doing is you are suppressing your own voters,” Raffensperger said in a telephone interview. “I have no control over what campaigns do, and if they do ill-advised actions that suppress their own vote, what can I do?”

Raffensperger also said he believes Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, tried to urge him to throw out absentee ballots. The state official criticized what he called a “campaign of misinformation, disinformation and outright lies about the process in Georgia.”

The Trump campaign has said it’s found widespread voting irregularities but has cited little evidence to substantiate its claims and none has emerged. Trump and his allies have also filed lawsuits in the state. One, alleging that fewer than 60 absentee ballots in Chatham County were improperly counted, has already been dismissed, while another that seeks to stop the state from certifying results is pending.

Raffensperger said that the state, which is conducting a hand recount of 5 million ballots cast in the election, is on track to complete that process by Wednesday night’s deadline and that he doesn’t expect significant changes in the vote totals. The state will also certify the results by Friday if a court doesn’t intervene. Trump can ask for a recount after that with ballots run through scanners, he said.

Graham, a South Carolina Republican, disputed Raffensperger’s accusation that he urged the Georgia secretary of state to toss ballots, first reported in the Washington Post, calling it “ridiculous.

“What I’m trying to find is how do you verify signatures on mail-in ballots in these states that are the center of attention,” Graham said.

But Raffensperger said Graham and Trump aren’t taking into account how the signature-matching system has been strengthened, including the addition of an online portal to allow a photo identification to be used.

The secretary of state’s office has been batting down rumors and half-truths about the election almost daily, including from the Trump campaign, he said.

“It’s just an outright lie what people are saying,” Raffensperger said.

Georgia’s two Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, have called on Raffensperger to resign. Republican Representative Doug Collins, a close ally of the president who’s overseeing the recount for the campaign, has also criticized Raffensperger.

“I guess if you’re a shill for President Trump you can get away with it, no one holds him accountable,” Raffensperger said of Collins.

Raffensperger said the audit now being completed should give voters confidence in the results.

“The reason we’ve done an audit is that we make sure that every legal vote has been counted, and that should give people assurance that we’re making sure that it’s a thorough process so there can be no question afterwards,” he said.

CORRECTIONS
- Hello loyal viewer. If you are reading this you most likely regularly watch my videos and know that I put corrections here. But the comment section on this video has been, to put it lightly, ""wild"". I don't think anyone is checking the corrections here! So I'm going to break with tradition and put the corrections in a pinned comment. But in short:
- I should have said I used the Chicago data (instead of a swing state, let's say) because that is what people claiming election fraud were using. I didn't pick it myself to make a point.
- Foolishly I cut a bit of the video where I talk about how Trump's data is also a bad Benford fit but that massive spike of 1s makes it look like a good match. Check out how low 3, 4 and 5 are.
- There has been specific criticism of aspects of that paper I read from, but only the usual back-and-forth of academics. Everyone agrees with the idea that Benford is not a magic tool to detect election fraud (nor is any statistical tool really; they all require careful interpretation).
- As always, let me know if you spot any other mistakes.

Thanks to my Patreon supporters who mean I can spend TWO DAYS trawling through election stats and making plots. I'm meant to be writing a new book you know. So, thanks a lot.

KpljCyzyBsQ,Bloomberg Quicktake: Now,UChirEOpgFCupRAk5etXqPaA,1605676013.0,LIVE: Georgia Election Officials Give Briefing as Trump Attacks Mail-In Voting,"(Nov. 17) The Republican secretary of state in Georgia said he believes that President Donald Trump cost himself votes with his campaign to undermine mail-in voting.

Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said Trump’s frequent and unsubstantiated accusations of mail-in voting fraud likely contributed to 24,500 people who voted in the state’s Republican primary not voting in the Nov. 3 election -- possibly accounting for President-elect Joe Biden’s 14,000-vote advantage in the state.

“In effect, what you’re doing is you are suppressing your own voters,” Raffensperger said in a telephone interview. “I have no control over what campaigns do, and if they do ill-advised actions that suppress their own vote, what can I do?”

Raffensperger also said he believes Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, tried to urge him to throw out absentee ballots. The state official criticized what he called a “campaign of misinformation, disinformation and outright lies about the process in Georgia.”

The Trump campaign has said it’s found widespread voting irregularities but has cited little evidence to substantiate its claims and none has emerged. Trump and his allies have also filed lawsuits in the state. One, alleging that fewer than 60 absentee ballots in Chatham County were improperly counted, has already been dismissed, while another that seeks to stop the state from certifying results is pending.

Raffensperger said that the state, which is conducting a hand recount of 5 million ballots cast in the election, is on track to complete that process by Wednesday night’s deadline and that he doesn’t expect significant changes in the vote totals. The state will also certify the results by Friday if a court doesn’t intervene. Trump can ask for a recount after that with ballots run through scanners, he said.

Graham, a South Carolina Republican, disputed Raffensperger’s accusation that he urged the Georgia secretary of state to toss ballots, first reported in the Washington Post, calling it “ridiculous.

“What I’m trying to find is how do you verify signatures on mail-in ballots in these states that are the center of attention,” Graham said.

But Raffensperger said Graham and Trump aren’t taking into account how the signature-matching system has been strengthened, including the addition of an online portal to allow a photo identification to be used.

The secretary of state’s office has been batting down rumors and half-truths about the election almost daily, including from the Trump campaign, he said.

“It’s just an outright lie what people are saying,” Raffensperger said.

Georgia’s two Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, have called on Raffensperger to resign. Republican Representative Doug Collins, a close ally of the president who’s overseeing the recount for the campaign, has also criticized Raffensperger.

“I guess if you’re a shill for President Trump you can get away with it, no one holds him accountable,” Raffensperger said of Collins.

Raffensperger said the audit now being completed should give voters confidence in the results.

“The reason we’ve done an audit is that we make sure that every legal vote has been counted, and that should give people assurance that we’re making sure that it’s a thorough process so there can be no question afterwards,” he said.

Since the presidential election on Nov. 3, Twitter and Facebook have flagged multiple posts by users, including President Donald Trump, who have made unsubstantiated claims of widespread election fraud, and president-elect Joe Biden's son Hunter. 

During the hearing, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz asked Dorsey if Twitter was behaving like a publisher when posting and moderating statements on voter fraud. 

When asked if voter fraud existed, Dorsey said ""I don't know for certain."" Cruz followed up asking the Twitter CEO if he was an expert on voter fraud with Dorsey replying, ""no, I'm not."" 

Cruz asserted that Twitter is posting warnings on any statements referencing voter fraud which Dorsey defended saying they were ""simply linking to a broader conversation."" Sen. Cruz disagreed with Dorsey, quoting a Twitter statement that read ""voter fraud is exceedingly rare in the United States.""

KpljCyzyBsQ,Bloomberg Quicktake: Now,UChirEOpgFCupRAk5etXqPaA,1605676013.0,LIVE: Georgia Election Officials Give Briefing as Trump Attacks Mail-In Voting,"(Nov. 17) The Republican secretary of state in Georgia said he believes that President Donald Trump cost himself votes with his campaign to undermine mail-in voting.

Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said Trump’s frequent and unsubstantiated accusations of mail-in voting fraud likely contributed to 24,500 people who voted in the state’s Republican primary not voting in the Nov. 3 election -- possibly accounting for President-elect Joe Biden’s 14,000-vote advantage in the state.

“In effect, what you’re doing is you are suppressing your own voters,” Raffensperger said in a telephone interview. “I have no control over what campaigns do, and if they do ill-advised actions that suppress their own vote, what can I do?”

Raffensperger also said he believes Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, tried to urge him to throw out absentee ballots. The state official criticized what he called a “campaign of misinformation, disinformation and outright lies about the process in Georgia.”

The Trump campaign has said it’s found widespread voting irregularities but has cited little evidence to substantiate its claims and none has emerged. Trump and his allies have also filed lawsuits in the state. One, alleging that fewer than 60 absentee ballots in Chatham County were improperly counted, has already been dismissed, while another that seeks to stop the state from certifying results is pending.

Raffensperger said that the state, which is conducting a hand recount of 5 million ballots cast in the election, is on track to complete that process by Wednesday night’s deadline and that he doesn’t expect significant changes in the vote totals. The state will also certify the results by Friday if a court doesn’t intervene. Trump can ask for a recount after that with ballots run through scanners, he said.

Graham, a South Carolina Republican, disputed Raffensperger’s accusation that he urged the Georgia secretary of state to toss ballots, first reported in the Washington Post, calling it “ridiculous.

“What I’m trying to find is how do you verify signatures on mail-in ballots in these states that are the center of attention,” Graham said.

But Raffensperger said Graham and Trump aren’t taking into account how the signature-matching system has been strengthened, including the addition of an online portal to allow a photo identification to be used.

The secretary of state’s office has been batting down rumors and half-truths about the election almost daily, including from the Trump campaign, he said.

“It’s just an outright lie what people are saying,” Raffensperger said.

Georgia’s two Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, have called on Raffensperger to resign. Republican Representative Doug Collins, a close ally of the president who’s overseeing the recount for the campaign, has also criticized Raffensperger.

“I guess if you’re a shill for President Trump you can get away with it, no one holds him accountable,” Raffensperger said of Collins.

Raffensperger said the audit now being completed should give voters confidence in the results.

“The reason we’ve done an audit is that we make sure that every legal vote has been counted, and that should give people assurance that we’re making sure that it’s a thorough process so there can be no question afterwards,” he said.

CORRECTIONS
- Hello loyal viewer. If you are reading this you most likely regularly watch my videos and know that I put corrections here. But the comment section on this video has been, to put it lightly, ""wild"". I don't think anyone is checking the corrections here! So I'm going to break with tradition and put the corrections in a pinned comment. But in short:
- I should have said I used the Chicago data (instead of a swing state, let's say) because that is what people claiming election fraud were using. I didn't pick it myself to make a point.
- Foolishly I cut a bit of the video where I talk about how Trump's data is also a bad Benford fit but that massive spike of 1s makes it look like a good match. Check out how low 3, 4 and 5 are.
- There has been specific criticism of aspects of that paper I read from, but only the usual back-and-forth of academics. Everyone agrees with the idea that Benford is not a magic tool to detect election fraud (nor is any statistical tool really; they all require careful interpretation).
- As always, let me know if you spot any other mistakes.

Thanks to my Patreon supporters who mean I can spend TWO DAYS trawling through election stats and making plots. I'm meant to be writing a new book you know. So, thanks a lot.

“In effect, what you’re doing is you are suppressing your own voters,” Raffensperger said in a telephone interview. “I have no control over what campaigns do, and if they do ill-advised actions that suppress their own vote, what can I do?”

Raffensperger also said he believes Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, tried to urge him to throw out absentee ballots. The state official criticized what he called a “campaign of misinformation, disinformation and outright lies about the process in Georgia.”

The Trump campaign has said it’s found widespread voting irregularities but has cited little evidence to substantiate its claims and none has emerged. Trump and his allies have also filed lawsuits in the state. One, alleging that fewer than 60 absentee ballots in Chatham County were improperly counted, has already been dismissed, while another that seeks to stop the state from certifying results is pending.

Raffensperger said that the state, which is conducting a hand recount of 5 million ballots cast in the election, is on track to complete that process by Wednesday night’s deadline and that he doesn’t expect significant changes in the vote totals. The state will also certify the results by Friday if a court doesn’t intervene. Trump can ask for a recount after that with ballots run through scanners, he said.

Graham, a South Carolina Republican, disputed Raffensperger’s accusation that he urged the Georgia secretary of state to toss ballots, first reported in the Washington Post, calling it “ridiculous.

“What I’m trying to find is how do you verify signatures on mail-in ballots in these states that are the center of attention,” Graham said.

But Raffensperger said Graham and Trump aren’t taking into account how the signature-matching system has been strengthened, including the addition of an online portal to allow a photo identification to be used.

The secretary of state’s office has been batting down rumors and half-truths about the election almost daily, including from the Trump campaign, he said.

“It’s just an outright lie what people are saying,” Raffensperger said.

Georgia’s two Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, have called on Raffensperger to resign. Republican Representative Doug Collins, a close ally of the president who’s overseeing the recount for the campaign, has also criticized Raffensperger.

“I guess if you’re a shill for President Trump you can get away with it, no one holds him accountable,” Raffensperger said of Collins.

Raffensperger said the audit now being completed should give voters confidence in the results.

“The reason we’ve done an audit is that we make sure that every legal vote has been counted, and that should give people assurance that we’re making sure that it’s a thorough process so there can be no question afterwards,” he said.

She is currently writing a book entitled Stonewalled (Harper Collins), which addresses the unseen influences of corporations and special interests on the information and images the public receives every day in the news and elsewhere. For twenty years (through March 2014), Attkisson was a correspondent for CBS News. In 2013, she received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Investigative Journalism for her reporting on “The Business of Congress,” which included an undercover investigation into fundraising by Republican freshmen. She also received Emmy nominations in 2013 for Benghazi: Dying for Security and Green Energy Going Red. Additionally, Attkisson received a 2013 Daytime Emmy Award as part of the CBS Sunday Morning team’s entry for Outstanding Morning Program for her report: “Washington Lobbying: K-Street Behind Closed Doors.” In September 2012, Attkisson also received an Emmy for Oustanding Investigative Journalism for the “Gunwalker: Fast and Furious” story. She received the RTNDA Edward R. Murrow Award for Excellence in Investigative Reporting for the same story. Attkisson received an Investigative Emmy Award in 2009 for her exclusive investigations into TARP and the bank bailout. She received an Investigative Emmy Award in 2002 for her series of exclusive reports about mismanagement at the Red Cross.

For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi 

Moderna said preliminary phase three trial data shows its coronavirus vaccine is more than 94% effective in preventing Covid-19 — a result CEO Stephane Bancel called a “game changer.”

The analysis evaluated 95 confirmed Covid-19 infections among the trial’s 30,000 participants. Moderna, which developed its vaccine in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said 90 cases of Covid-19 were observed in the placebo group versus five cases observed in the group that received its two-dose vaccine. That resulted in an estimated vaccine efficacy of 94.5%, it said.

Shares of the company jumped more than 12% in premarket trading.

The announcement comes on the heels of similar news last week from Pfizer’s late-stage Covid-19 vaccine trial as pharmaceutical companies across the world race against the clock to find ways to prevent the virus, which has spread to more than 54.4 million people, killing more than 1.3 million, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told CNBC on Monday that U.S. Food and Drug Administration will move “as quickly as possible” to clear Pfizer and Moderna’s coronavirus vaccines for emergency use.

Bancel called it a “pivotal moment.”

“Since early January, we have chased this virus with the intent to protect as many people around the world as possible. All along, we have known that each day matters,” he said in a statement. “This positive interim analysis from our Phase 3 study has given us the first clinical validation that our vaccine can prevent COVID-19 disease, including severe disease.”

The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company also said there were no “significant” safety concerns, adding the vaccine was generally safe and well tolerated with the majority of adverse events in participants being labeled as mild or moderate. Side effects included pain at the injection site and, after the second dose, fatigue, muscle pain and headaches.

“Knowing that we have a vaccine that would help more people who would take it is just a wonderful feeling,” Bancel said in an interview with CNBC. “As you know a lot of people have been reluctant in surveys to take a vaccine because I think we’re worried about the politicization of a vaccine, they’re worried about what you get with a flu shot you know 50% to 60% efficacy.”

With an efficacy rate of 95%, “that’s a game changer, I believe,” he said.

Bancel said the company plans to test the vaccine in teens “very soon,” followed by children under the age of 12. “We have to be very, very careful because safety is priority No. 1,” he said in a separate interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” adding most trials test vaccines on healthy adults first to assess safety.

It comes after the goal of securing a Covid-19 vaccine moved a step closer with early data showing a new jab to be almost 95% effective in protecting against the virus.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DZjtiqujql8/hqdefault.jpg,2020-11-17 13:47:04.087655,Right,0.0,['None'],Neutral,False,1,u0muJSMN_ac,3,Moderna

Five ways to avoid catching the virus indoors

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-53917432

If it's stuffy, walk away

Dr. David Davies, technical director of the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers

If you've got someone who's infected in a building, and you're bringing in plenty of outside air, you're diluting whatever infectious material they're giving off. 

You're reducing the risk of other people becoming infected.

Look up at the air conditioning

Split air conditioner

If there had been a good supply of outside air, very likely fewer people would have become infected - if any

One person infects 9 in China

Ask about the 'fresh air ratio'

Prof Cath Noakes, Leeds, Environmental panel, SAGE

Having 100% outside air or close to 100% is a good thing

The more fresh air, the less you're running the risk of recirculating the virus through the building

Get the office management to check if there's virus in the filters

Is there someone shedding in the building?

South Korea, 11th floor, one person infects 90

Watch out for draughts
An infected person sitting by an open window or ventilation source
Downwind effect
Dilution effect outweighs the risk
Viral dilution

Professor Uğur Şahin (immunologist)

Founder of the firm

No serious side effects

We did not see any other serious side effects which would result in pausing or halting of the study

Key side effects

Pain in the injection site for a few days

Some participants, mild to moderate fever for one or two days

We did not see any other serious side-effects which would result in the pausing or halting of the study

So far, the safety profile seems to be absolutely benign

The next few months

This winter will be hard

We will not have a big impact on infection numbers

300 million doses by April 2021

This will start the impact

Biggest effect summer 2021

Must have a high vaccination rate by autumn / winter 2021

Normal winter next year

Will the vaccine prevent viral transmission?

I'm very confident that transmission between people will be reduced by such a highly effective vaccine

maybe not 90% but maybe 50%

but we should not forget that even that could result in a dramatic reduction of the pandemic spread

How long will immunity last?
Antibody response in patients, will decline over time
Booster immunisation should not be too complicated

Implications

Unlikely herd immunity can eliminate SARS-CoV-2

Subsequent infections likely to be milder

Virus likely to go on circulating in the human population

Vaccine will not provide lifelong infection

Vaccine studies should include patients who have recovered from COVID

People who have had COVID should be vaccinated

People who have had COVID should continue with public health measures

Residual low level of antibodies may have controlled the second infection

No mRNA vaccine has ever been approved by the FDA, but Pfizer and BioNTech hope to receive emergency approval based on preliminary data from their ongoing vaccine trial.  

This two-dose vaccine regimen has limitations including the need for -70 C refrigeration and many questions remain: 
Will the vaccine prevent transmission and asymptomatic spread?  
How long will immunity last?  
Will “90% effective” hold up to peer-review and additional data when it is gathered?

Antibodies increased during 2 months after diagnosis

Remained on a plateau for the remainder of the study

In quarantined people

2.3% were seropositive

In people not known to have been exposed

0.3% tested antibody positive
Conclusions

We estimate that 0.9% of Icelanders were infected with SARS-CoV-2

To assess serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels in hospitalized patients with COVID-19

Analyze the possible influence of vitamin D status on disease severity

Retrospective

Case-control

216 COVID-19 patients

197 population-based controls

Results

Vitamin D deficiency was defined as serum 25OHD levels  less than 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/L) 

COVID patients group

Mean levels 13.8  ng/ml. (34.5 nmol/L)

82.2% vitamin D deficient 

Community control group

Mean levels 20.9 ng/ml (52.25 nmol/L) (p less than 0.0001)

47.2% vitamin D deficient

Blood levels lower in men than in women


Evidence of protective role of Ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation in reducing COVID-19 deaths (Nature scientific reports, 19th October 2020)

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74825-z

Ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation, mediated by vitamin D synthesis

Dataset of 152 countries over 108 days (n = 6,524)

A permanent unit increase in UVI is associated with a 1.2 percentage points decline in daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths

and a 1.0 percentage points decline in the CFR daily growth rate

Globally
Minus 12% of cumulative COVID-19 deaths

Minus 38% on CFR

We find a significant negative association between UVI and COVID-19 deaths

indicating evidence of the protective role of UVB in mitigating COVID-19 deaths

If confirmed via clinical studies, then the possibility of mitigating COVID-19 deaths via sensible sunlight exposure or vitamin D intervention would be very attractive

Five ways to avoid catching the virus indoors

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-53917432

If it's stuffy, walk away

Dr. David Davies, technical director of the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers

If you've got someone who's infected in a building, and you're bringing in plenty of outside air, you're diluting whatever infectious material they're giving off. 

You're reducing the risk of other people becoming infected.

Look up at the air conditioning

Split air conditioner

If there had been a good supply of outside air, very likely fewer people would have become infected - if any

One person infects 9 in China

Ask about the 'fresh air ratio'

Prof Cath Noakes, Leeds, Environmental panel, SAGE

Having 100% outside air or close to 100% is a good thing

The more fresh air, the less you're running the risk of recirculating the virus through the building

Get the office management to check if there's virus in the filters

Is there someone shedding in the building?

Low-dose Hydroxychloroquine Therapy and Mortality in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: A Nationwide Observational Study of 8075 Participants (International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, 24 August)

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920303423

Background

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been largely used and investigated as therapy of COVID-19 , at total dose usually ranging from 2400 mg to 9600 mg.

In Belgium, off-label use of low-dose HCQ (2400 mg in total over five days) was recommended for hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

“low-dose” regimen of HCQ sulphate in monotherapy 

400mg twice on day 1

200mg twice a day from day 2 to 5

i.e. a total dose of 2400 mg

Methods

Multi-centric design 

Vast majority of Belgian hospitals

Retrospective analysis

In-hospital mortality in Belgium

40 day follow up

No difference in the baseline characteristics

Groups

HCQ alone and supportive care

Supportive care only

Adjusted for demographic and clinical features

Results

8075 patients with complete discharge data

HCQ group, n = 4,542

Deaths, 804, (17.7%)

no-HCQ group, n = 3,533

Deaths, 957 (27.1%)

Multivariable analysis

Mortality was lower in the HCQ group compared to the no-HCQ group 

Hazard ratio = 0.684

Estimated direct-adjusted mortality at 40 days 

19.1% with HCQ alone

26.5% with supportive care only

Mortality in the HCQ group was reduced

Both in patients diagnosed in less than 5 days and more than 5 days

Conclusions

Compared to supportive care only, low-dose HCQ monotherapy was independently associated with lower mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 diagnosed and treated early or later after symptom onset.

9,200 mg over 10 days

Conclusion

In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine was not associated with reductions in 28-day mortality

Was associated with an increased length of hospital stay and increased risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death

Matt Hancock

I have asked the scientists to look once again at the impact of vitamin D on resistance and immunity. 

There has been some updated evidence that has come to light in the past few weeks, and I want to ensure that it is fully taken into account

The Scottish Government are sending four months supply of vitamin D to everybody who shielded in Scotland

Given that it is low cost and there is no medical downside, will our Government consider the same approach in England?

Press release from the French National Academy of Medicine 22 May 2020 

http://www.academie-medecine.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/20.5.22-Vitamine-D-et-coronavirus-ENG.pdf

Vitamin D is a prohormone

Synthesized in the dermis under the effect of ultraviolet light

Transported to the liver and kidneys, where it is transformed into an active hormone

Responsible for intestinal absorption of calcium and bone health. 

Modulates the functioning of the immune system by stimulating macrophages and dendritic cells

Role in regulating and suppressing the cytokine inflammatory response

Acute respiratory distress syndrome

A significant correlation between low serum vitamin D levels and mortality from Covid- 19

This phenomenon follows a North-South gradient

Exceptions are Nordic countries, vitamin D supplementation

Not a preventive or a therapeutic

By mitigating the inflammatory storm and its consequences, considered as an adjunct to any form of therapy. 

Simple and inexpensive measure

Confirms its recommendation to ensure vitamin D supplementation in the French population

Recommends the rapid serum vitamin D (i.e. 25 OHD) testing in people over 60 years of age with Covid-19

Loading dose of 50,000 to 100,000 IU in case of deficiency, which could help limit respiratory complications; 

Recommends vitamin D supplementation of 800 to 1000 IU/day in people under 60, as soon as the diagnosis of Covid-19 is confirmed. 


Vitamin D: A Low-Hanging Fruit in COVID-19? (Medscape)

Observational data from various countries suggest inverse links;

Severity of COVID-19 responses
Mortality

No randomized controlled trial

Having adequate vitamin D is important, especially for those at the highest risk of COVID-19

No role
Simply a marker
A causal factor

Spain and northern Italy, high rates of vitamin D deficiency

Spain and Italy not formally fortify foods or recommend supplementation

Norway, Finland, and Sweden had higher vitamin D levels

European countries, P = .046, 95.4% confidence, (4.6% chance this result arose by chance)

Correlation is not causality

Optimizing vitamin D status to recommendations by national and international public health agencies will certainly have, potential benefits for COVID-19 (Irish Medical Journal), http://imj.ie/vitamin-d-and-inflammation-potential-implications-for-severity-of-covid-19/

Our study shows that over time there is a reduction in the proportion of people testing positive for antibodies. 

Testing positive for antibodies does not mean you are immune to COVID-19. 

It remains unclear what level of immunity antibodies provide, or for how long this immunity lasts. 

If someone tests positive for antibodies:

they still need to follow national guidelines including …

social distancing measures

getting a swab test if they have symptoms

and wearing face coverings where required

SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity in cases of COVID-19 and SARS, and uninfected controls (Nature 15th July)

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z?flip=true

Memory T cells induced by previous pathogens can greatly influence future infections

Individuals convalescing from COVID-19

n = 36

All had N protein recognising T cells

Patients who recovered from SARS (One, 2003)

n = 23

Possess long-lasting memory T cells, reactive to the N protein of SARS-CoV

These have lasted for 17 years

These T cells displayed robust cross-reactivity to the N protein of SARS-CoV-2

We also detected SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in individuals with no history of SARS or COVID-19 (n = 37)

In some people with no previous SARS one or two, or exposure to contacts

SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in uninfected donors exhibited a different pattern of immunodominance

Targeting different proteins on the N protein

These proteins are highly conserved in animal betacoronaviruses

But have low homology to ‘common cold’ human-associated coronaviruses

So

Infection with betacoronaviruses induces multi-specific and long-lasting T cell immunity against the structural N protein

Low-dose Hydroxychloroquine Therapy and Mortality in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: A Nationwide Observational Study of 8075 Participants (International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, 24 August)

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920303423

Background

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been largely used and investigated as therapy of COVID-19 , at total dose usually ranging from 2400 mg to 9600 mg.

In Belgium, off-label use of low-dose HCQ (2400 mg in total over five days) was recommended for hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

“low-dose” regimen of HCQ sulphate in monotherapy 

400mg twice on day 1

200mg twice a day from day 2 to 5

i.e. a total dose of 2400 mg

Methods

Multi-centric design 

Vast majority of Belgian hospitals

Retrospective analysis

In-hospital mortality in Belgium

40 day follow up

No difference in the baseline characteristics

Groups

HCQ alone and supportive care

Supportive care only

Adjusted for demographic and clinical features

Results

8075 patients with complete discharge data

HCQ group, n = 4,542

Deaths, 804, (17.7%)

no-HCQ group, n = 3,533

Deaths, 957 (27.1%)

Multivariable analysis

Mortality was lower in the HCQ group compared to the no-HCQ group 

Hazard ratio = 0.684

Estimated direct-adjusted mortality at 40 days 

19.1% with HCQ alone

26.5% with supportive care only

Mortality in the HCQ group was reduced

Both in patients diagnosed in less than 5 days and more than 5 days

Conclusions

Compared to supportive care only, low-dose HCQ monotherapy was independently associated with lower mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 diagnosed and treated early or later after symptom onset.

Hydroxychloroquine group, n = 1,561

Usual care group, n = 3,155 

Patients allocated to hydroxychloroquine sulfate (200mg) received a loading dose of 4 tablets (800 mg) at zero and 6 hours, followed by 2 tablets (400 mg) starting at 12 hours after the initial dose and then every 12 hours for the next 9 days

9,200 mg over 10 days

Conclusion

In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine was not associated with reductions in 28-day mortality

Was associated with an increased length of hospital stay and increased risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death

KpljCyzyBsQ,Bloomberg Quicktake: Now,UChirEOpgFCupRAk5etXqPaA,1605676013.0,LIVE: Georgia Election Officials Give Briefing as Trump Attacks Mail-In Voting,"(Nov. 17) The Republican secretary of state in Georgia said he believes that President Donald Trump cost himself votes with his campaign to undermine mail-in voting.

Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said Trump’s frequent and unsubstantiated accusations of mail-in voting fraud likely contributed to 24,500 people who voted in the state’s Republican primary not voting in the Nov. 3 election -- possibly accounting for President-elect Joe Biden’s 14,000-vote advantage in the state.

“In effect, what you’re doing is you are suppressing your own voters,” Raffensperger said in a telephone interview. “I have no control over what campaigns do, and if they do ill-advised actions that suppress their own vote, what can I do?”

Raffensperger also said he believes Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, tried to urge him to throw out absentee ballots. The state official criticized what he called a “campaign of misinformation, disinformation and outright lies about the process in Georgia.”

The Trump campaign has said it’s found widespread voting irregularities but has cited little evidence to substantiate its claims and none has emerged. Trump and his allies have also filed lawsuits in the state. One, alleging that fewer than 60 absentee ballots in Chatham County were improperly counted, has already been dismissed, while another that seeks to stop the state from certifying results is pending.

Raffensperger said that the state, which is conducting a hand recount of 5 million ballots cast in the election, is on track to complete that process by Wednesday night’s deadline and that he doesn’t expect significant changes in the vote totals. The state will also certify the results by Friday if a court doesn’t intervene. Trump can ask for a recount after that with ballots run through scanners, he said.

Graham, a South Carolina Republican, disputed Raffensperger’s accusation that he urged the Georgia secretary of state to toss ballots, first reported in the Washington Post, calling it “ridiculous.

“What I’m trying to find is how do you verify signatures on mail-in ballots in these states that are the center of attention,” Graham said.

But Raffensperger said Graham and Trump aren’t taking into account how the signature-matching system has been strengthened, including the addition of an online portal to allow a photo identification to be used.

The secretary of state’s office has been batting down rumors and half-truths about the election almost daily, including from the Trump campaign, he said.

“It’s just an outright lie what people are saying,” Raffensperger said.

Georgia’s two Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, have called on Raffensperger to resign. Republican Representative Doug Collins, a close ally of the president who’s overseeing the recount for the campaign, has also criticized Raffensperger.

“I guess if you’re a shill for President Trump you can get away with it, no one holds him accountable,” Raffensperger said of Collins.

Raffensperger said the audit now being completed should give voters confidence in the results.

“The reason we’ve done an audit is that we make sure that every legal vote has been counted, and that should give people assurance that we’re making sure that it’s a thorough process so there can be no question afterwards,” he said.

dqv5E1Jd51E,Bloomberg Quicktake: Now,UChirEOpgFCupRAk5etXqPaA,1604715209.0,LIVE: America Locks Down From Atlantic to Pacific as Covid Rages | 24/7 Breaking News,"(Nov. 17) In a matter of days, America’s long effort to revive its virus-battered economy has been put on pause -- or thrown into reverse -- as new infections soar at the fastest pace since the pandemic’s earliest days.

California on Monday reinstituted bans on many indoor businesses, and its governor warned he may impose a curfew. Michigan has ordered a three-week partial shutdown, while states including Oregon, Washington and New Jersey tightened curbs. Even the governor of Iowa, long resistant to virus rules, issued a limited mask mandate Monday.

The new restrictions follow a rapid surge in cases -- with the country adding a million infections in the first 10 days of November alone -- that has led health officials to issue dire warnings about the prospect of uncontrollable outbreaks as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches. In a call with governors on Monday, Deborah Birx, a key member of the White House’s coronavirus task force, said the increase is showing no signs of a plateau and that nursing homes, in particular, are being hard-hit.

“The whole country is on fire,” said Ellie Murray, assistant professor of epidemiology at the Boston University School of Public Health. “Since people can be infectious before they have symptoms, a lot of people right now are infectious and transmitting to people and don’t know it. We’re trying to get a grip on this large explosion.”

Vice President Mike Pence told governors during a video conference Monday that the government had 20,000 hospital beds available around the country to handle patients, and that states had 13,000 more, according to a summary provided by Washington Governor Jay Inslee’s office. About 149,000 new cases were reported that day, according to the Covid Tracking Project.

The nation’s average new-case count for the past seven days has jumped 37%, according to Johns Hopkins University data, the fastest at any point in the U.S. since late March. Pennsylvania has seen a 14% jump in total cases, while Ohio’s have surged 19%, Washington state’s climbed 11% and Illinois’s are up 18%. Michigan’s cases have increased 20%, the most since April.

And in California, the number of new cases spotted each day surged more than 51% during the first week of November, according to the state -- faster than the 39% increase it endured during its last coronavirus wave in June.

“The rate of increase is simply without precedent in California,” Governor Gavin Newsom said Monday during a briefing. “Every age group, every demographic -- racial, ethnic -- in every part of this state, we are seeing case rates increase.”

The state, home to about 40 million residents, enacted tight restrictions on counties totaling 94% of its population, including shutting indoor dining, gyms, places of worship and theaters.

On the White House task force call with governors, Birx said many states hit by the summer’s coronavirus surge saw case counts level off after 30 days, but that hasn’t happened this time. Seema Verma, administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said infections have sharply increased among nursing-home patients since October, and controlling spread at the facilities is a priority, according to the summary.

Infections aren’t isolated to a few geographic regions, as they were in earlier stages of the pandemic. They are rising simultaneously in urban and rural areas alike, in the Midwest and the South, as well as the east and west coasts.

“This thing is spreading like wildfire all across the country,” Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said during a Monday news conference. He said he would issue new restrictions on Wednesday if infection rates don’t drop, although he didn’t say what they would be. “I don’t want to ever see a refrigeration truck coming into the state because we need it for our lost loved ones,” Beshear said.

jFz2Oex1G1M,Bloomberg Quicktake: Now,UChirEOpgFCupRAk5etXqPaA,1605674656.0,Senate Blocks Judy Shelton Nomination to Federal Reserve in Defeat for McConnell,"Judy Shelton’s nomination to the Federal Reserve Board was blocked in the Senate Tuesday, a stunning defeat for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and a blow to President Donald Trump’s drive to reshape the U.S. central bank before he leaves office.

After Covid-19 exposure forced two Republican senators into quarantine, the GOP was left short of enough votes needed to overcome united Democratic opposition.

Republican Senators Mitt Romney and Susan Collins joined with 47 Democrats and two independents in a 50-47 vote against advancing Shelton’s nomination. Once the outcome was clear, McConnell switched his vote to no, a tactical move that would allow him to bring the nomination up for reconsideration later.

McConnell’s plans to confirm Shelton were blown up Tuesday morning when Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley announced he would be in quarantine after exposure to someone who tested positive for Covid-19. GOP Senator Rick Scott of Florida also is in quarantine. Both were expected to back Shelton.

Shelton, 66, a former informal adviser to Trump, was long known for her advocacy of a return to the gold standard, ultra-hawkish views on inflation and opposition to federal deposit insurance. She provoked further controversy and opposition by abandoning those views and calling for interest-rate cuts to align herself with Trump as she emerged as a candidate for a Fed post.

0KRSWb53YKs,The Cato Institute,UCyl7zwI6giPG6zC3uC8GGVg,1605675521.0,Injustice for All: How Financial Incentives Corrupted and Can Fix the US Criminal Justice System,"America’s criminal justice system is more profoundly broken than most people realize. 

In their new book, ""Injustice for All: How Financial Incentives Corrupted and Can Fix the US Criminal Justice System,"" professors Chris Surprenant and Jason Brennan show that much of our system’s dysfunction is simply the result of rational actors responding predictably to economic incentives.

Although other factors such as race certainly play a role, “when it comes to the color of justice in America,” they argue, “follow the money. What matters even more than black and white is green.”

Our criminal justice system spends approximately $300 billion per year and employs nearly three million people, and in many ways, it acts like the big business it has become.

Not surprisingly, this “prison‐​industrial complex” is highly resistant to change because, as Surprenant and Brennan explain, all of the people employed by the system “have a personal stake in preventing the types of reform that would make their jobs go away.”

Despite the strong case that incarceration is often unjustifiably harsh and causes more problems than it solves, we go right on locking people up and earning our status as the world’s most prolific jailers of human beings.

Are we doomed to this punitive nightmare, or is there some way to resist our incentive‐​driven addiction to incarceration?

Authors Surprenant and Brennan discuss this and other important questions with Clark Neily, Vice President for Criminal Justice at the Cato Institute.

He’s written more than twice as many majority opinions in this area than any of his colleagues, which gives his jurisprudence staying power. There’s a certain resolve, at once philosophical and tactical, at work here. In 95 percent of the free‐​expression cases decided during his 15‐​year tenure, Roberts has been in the majority. Equally revealing, Roberts has taken the lead opinion nearly 30 percent of the time. In other words, there’s something special about this genre of cases, something that speaks to who Roberts is and what he hopes the Court bearing his name might be remembered for. In the first comprehensive report on the Roberts Court’s free‐​speech jurisprudence, Ronald Collins and David Hudson—each of whom has published more than 10 books on free speech—examine the 56 such cases handed down by the Roberts Court from 2005 through 2020. Beyond its focus on Chief Justice Roberts, the authors’ eye‐​opening study provides a detailed look at the cases, the justices’ differing approaches, and lawyers who have played key roles in influencing the Court.

Costs and Benefits of the Electoral College

Featuring John Samples and Caleb O. Brown

Some people claim the Electoral College, the method by which Americans choose a President, has racist origins, that it protects rural states at the expense of big cities, and that the institution should be replaced by a national popular vote. John Samples discusses the claims.

But, as Johan Norberg argues, openness is critical to human success.

The freedom to explore and exchange has led to stunning achievements in science and culture as well as unprecedented wealth and opportunity.

Yet humanity has always struggled with a constant tension between its yearning for cooperation and its profound need for belonging to a particular tribe.

In this discussion, Norberg will explain why we’re often uncomfortable with openness and why it is nonetheless essential for human progress. He will explain why an open world and an open economy are worth fighting for, now more than ever. Tom Palmer will comment on the book’s sweeping history and relevance.

That might seem like a far‐​off concern, but it shouldn’t.

The editors of A Fiscal Cliff: New Perspectives on the U.S. Federal Debt Crisis call our attention to a problem that has never gone away, one that could easily lead to a catastrophe: How will future generations pay for our profligacy? Better yet, how do we get deficit spending under control? Are there any workable, realistic proposals for balancing the budget or for implementing automatic budget balancing measures? What might happen if we don’t get the exploding federal debt under control?

The U.S. federal government has been in a deteriorating fiscal position since the early 2000s. Meanwhile, several countries including Switzerland and Chile have implemented successful rules‐​based debt brakes that have achieved fiscal discipline without political or economic disruption. The contributors to this volume explore their efforts among others as they seek to bring balanced budgets back to Washington.

spe619WX-Q4,Hoover Institution,UCzWwWbbKHg4aodl0S35R6XA,1485239095.0,What's wrong with the American economy?,"Recorded on September 8, 2016

The American economy’s biggest problem is growth.  To achieve growth, Hoover Institution fellow John Cochrane argues,  America needs to simplify the tax code and deregulate the economy. He discusses how government agencies must conduct serious, transparent, and retrospective cost-benefit analyses, get rid of special interests, and remove disincentives if they want businesses to flourish. Cochrane notes that the US economy needs more innovation, deep tax reform, and better regulations to unleash growth. When business owners can depend on good policy and not pay for play, they will start and invest in their companies and the economy will expand.

Cochrane discusses the future of American economic growth and how he believes it can be fixed. Cochrane encourages us to have more faith in democracy because if the right policies are put in place the economy will quickly improve and everyone will be better off. 

According to Cochrane, ""America needs better policy and governance under the rule of law."" He also discusses the benefits of lowering and even ending corporate taxes to reduce price inflation and outsourcing jobs overseas. Cochrane points out that the ability to bring people together to get good bills through is what a great politician like Lincoln did; it is hoped that the next president will do this.

Robinson and Cochrane further debate technological innovation, the role of robots in the economy, and whether Americans need to be concerned about robots taking over our jobs.

HrmN_jXExVY,New Economic Thinking,UCp5hG8rt1z2MJ9aNVxY2Xdg,1433895901.0,"How Elite Power Brokers Corrupt our Finances, Freedom, and Security","From the Tea Party to Occupy Wall Street, however divergent their political views, these groups seem united by one thing: outrage over a system of power and influence that only serves the interests of a small number of corrupt elites. Increasingly, protesters on both ends of the political spectrum and the media are using the word “corrupt” to describe an illusory system of power that has shed any accountability to those it was meant to help and govern.  In her new book, Janine Wedel, a university professor in the School of Public Policy at George Mason University and a grantee of the Institute for New Economic Thinking, charts a fast–evolving system of power and influence that is utterly unaccountable to those it is supposed to serve, largely because “we the public” has an information problem.  Who is accountable?  What are the remedies available to the average citizen?

If there is accountability, it is in places which are not socially represented or publicly accessible.  The elites have access to these “silos” of power, because they can connect the dots.  The average citizen cannot.  As they languish, one thing flourishes: a new, insidious form of corruption practiced by players cutting across boundaries and plying influence with unprecedented ease.

The hallmark of this alarming ""new corruption"" is the violation of public trust.  Professor Wedel takes us far beyond the usual targets: money's corrupting effect on politics, K Street lobbyists, bad–apple politicians who take bribes. While all those are important, the new corruption's sweep is broader and its practitioners, even when they are named, can't be shamed. They believe they can self–police, because their motives are pure and their integrity beyond questioning.  And even when their motives are not pure, it doesn’t serve today’s technocrats to rock the boat by punishing these elites.   And those guilty of wrongdoing are often in a position to manipulate media and shape the story to make it appear as if they are indeed selfless public servants.

In this new world, academics, Wall Street bankers, lawyers, retired generals, even former Presidents and Prime Ministers exploit their prestige as if it were a commodity, some turning themselves into one–man brands. Think tanks, once the source of sober–minded studies, often now act as bullhorns for the powerful. Wall Street, unbowed by the 2008 crash, remains free to ""innovate"" us into the next financial disaster after fighting a stealth regulatory battle.

Part of today’s challenge is that the institutions that we grew up with are completely different animals.  Even though a bank is still called “a bank”, but it is very different institution than was the case even 15 years ago.  Likewise with government.  Three-quarters of people who work for “the public sector” today are actually still in the private sector.  They work as private contractors or consultants.  This places them beyond the scope of proper public scrutiny, and further undermines accountability.  Indeed, Wedel notes that the image of the so-called “revolving door” is probably inaccurate these days.  The door doesn’t revolve as such, but remains perpetually open to these private elites, changing the latter’s role well beyond what we normally understand government to be.

In the interview, Wedel tries to guide us through this maze.  Her message is a very unpalatable one, but it is still the case that a malady, no matter how grave, cannot be repaired without an accurate diagnosis.  That diagnosis starts here in Wedel’s profound scholarship and searing insights.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HrmN_jXExVY/hqdefault.jpg,2020-11-17 13:47:16.910529,Right,-0.3333333333333333,"['PartisanLeft', 'Educational', 'Educational']",Neutral,False,3,0KRSWb53YKs,4,Gavin Newsom

Tom Richey explains the powers of the distinctive characteristics of the two houses of the United States Congress: the Senate and the House of Representatives.  The Senate is the Upper House of Congress where all states are represented equally in a small legislative body with aristocratic traditions.  The House of Representatives, or Lower House, is a larger body with seats apportioned based on population.  In addition to its unique aristocratic traditions of ""senatorial courtesy,"" the Senate has the distinct powers of ratifying treaties and confirming presidential appointments to the federal bench, the cabinet, and of foreign ambassadors.  The House, being closest to the people and elected more often, has the sole authority to initiate revenue (taxation) bills.

In their new book, ""Injustice for All: How Financial Incentives Corrupted and Can Fix the US Criminal Justice System,"" professors Chris Surprenant and Jason Brennan show that much of our system’s dysfunction is simply the result of rational actors responding predictably to economic incentives.

Although other factors such as race certainly play a role, “when it comes to the color of justice in America,” they argue, “follow the money. What matters even more than black and white is green.”

Our criminal justice system spends approximately $300 billion per year and employs nearly three million people, and in many ways, it acts like the big business it has become.

Not surprisingly, this “prison‐​industrial complex” is highly resistant to change because, as Surprenant and Brennan explain, all of the people employed by the system “have a personal stake in preventing the types of reform that would make their jobs go away.”

Despite the strong case that incarceration is often unjustifiably harsh and causes more problems than it solves, we go right on locking people up and earning our status as the world’s most prolific jailers of human beings.

Are we doomed to this punitive nightmare, or is there some way to resist our incentive‐​driven addiction to incarceration?

Authors Surprenant and Brennan discuss this and other important questions with Clark Neily, Vice President for Criminal Justice at the Cato Institute.

He has been both applauded and criticized by both ends of the political spectrum. He also has begun to craft his legacy as Chief Justice and leader not only of the Supreme Court but of the entire federal judiciary. This panel will present a range of views on the first ten years of the Roberts Court. The panelists bring a variety of perspectives: practitioner, journalist, academic, and Senate staff at the time of his confirmation. They will discuss the substance of the Roberts Court's opinions, what legacy the Chief Justice is crafting, whether he is succeeding in shaping the Court into a ""Roberts Court,"" and whether his jurisprudence is consistent with what was expected at the time he was appointed.
