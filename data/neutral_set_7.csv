The Supreme Court will decide whether Electoral College voters have a constitutional right to cast ballots for candidates who didn’t win their state’s popular vote, the justices announced in an order on Friday.

The justices said they will hear two cases brought by Electoral College voters in Washington state and Colorado who refused to vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016 despite her wins in those states.

Like most states, Washington and Colorado require their electors to follow the will of their states’ voters. But those laws are now being challenged by Electoral College voters who argue that such laws are unconstitutional.

A decision in the matter is expected by the end of June, ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November. The cases are the latest in a string of high-profile disputes the top court is expected to resolve in a contentious election year.

Historically, the faithfulness of Electoral College voters has largely been a formality. In 2016, 10 out of the total 538 electors attempted to cast ballots out of line with their state’s popular vote. But attorneys on both sides of the issue urged the top court to resolve the constitutional question before a crisis emerges.

Watch more 2020 US election coverage at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

Long before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, low-wage workers in the United States were already struggling to pay their rent, and were being evicted at rates much higher than in other similar countries. In the US, one in 40 renters has been evicted ー compared to one in 89 in the UK, one in 227 in Denmark, and one in 25,000 in France. 

Since the pandemic took millions of US jobs in March and April, most workers who make more than $20 an hour have been able to keep working, or have returned to work. But low wage workers — the people most likely to be renters instead of homeowners — are also the least likely to have gotten their jobs back. Now, seven months into the pandemic, millions aren't working, and many of them are facing homelessness.

In this video we ask what other governments around the world have done to keep people in their homes, what the US has done, what it could do, and if the 2020 election could change any of it.

Watch more 2020 US election explainers at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

In the middle of the 20th century, the US government made a decision that would transform American cities: It built a huge system of interstate highways, many of which went right through the downtowns of its biggest cities.

This sealed the country's fate as a car culture, and today we're seeing the results. In most cities, it's extremely difficult to get around without a car, in part due to public transit systems built to serve an outdated commute. And when our politics turn to infrastructure, the government often favors building new roads and highways instead of improving and expanding public transportation.

The result is a system that forces more Americans to drive, at the expense of those who rely on public transit. It's also the biggest contributor to our country’s carbon footprint. Fixing that over the long term will require a reimagining of American cities and towns. But there's also a way that, if we wanted to, we could improve American transit systems, and get more people riding them, in a matter of weeks.

Why Democratic Socialism Is Gaining Popularity In The United States",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BlrDpTGRREA/hqdefault.jpg,2020-11-02 18:55:24.812086,Neutral,-0.2,"['Mainstream News', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanLeft', 'Mainstream News', 'Mainstream News']",Neutral,True,2,WlYyC5-xv_A,0,Electoral College

Watch more of our election coverage: http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

In the 2000 US presidential election, the Democratic candidate got half a million more votes than the Republican. The Democrat lost. Sixteen years later the same thing happened again. In the US, if you run for president, it does not actually matter how many people in the country vote for you. What matters instead is an arcane system for selecting America’s head of state called the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is the reason the US has something called “swing states,” and it’s the reason those places get to decide the future of the country. It’s the reason presidential candidates almost never campaign in the country’s biggest cities. And more recently, it’s also the reason that Republican candidates have been able to eke out victories in the presidential election without actually getting the most votes.

The Electoral College makes some Americans’ votes more powerful than others. In fact, that’s part of the reason we have it to begin with; in the country’s early years, the Electoral College helped give the votes of Southern Whites more weight than the votes of Northerners. The idea at its core, that certain votes simply matter more than others, is baked into the American tradition. In the 2020 election, it may decide the winner.

The historian Alexander Keyssar’s book “Why Do We Still Have the Electoral College?” takes you through the history and function of the Electoral College: https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674660151

For the bite-sized version of that history, Keyssar also wrote this piece in the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/opinion/electoral-college-racism-white-supremacy.html

The Times also had a great interactive feature on where the 2020 candidates actually spent money: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/17/us/politics/trump-biden-campaign-ad-spending.html

Pew has a breakdown of how democracies around the world elect their head of state, which really shows what an oddball the US is: https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/22/among-democracies-u-s-stands-out-in-how-it-chooses-its-head-of-state/

Japan’s bullet trains can reach nearly 200 miles per hour and date to the 1960s. They have moved more than 9 billion people without a single passenger causality. casualty 

France began service of the high-speed TGV train in 1981 and the rest of Europe quickly followed.

But the U.S. has no true high-speed trains, aside from sections of Amtrak’s Acela line in the Northeast Corridor. The Acela can reach 150 mph for only 34 miles of its 457-mile span. Its average speed between New York and Boston is about 65 mph.

California’s high-speed rail system is under construction, but whether it will ever get completed as intended is uncertain.

Watch the video to see why the U.S. continues to fail with high-speed trains, and some companies that are trying to fix that.

(Subscribe: https://bit.ly/C4_News_Subscribe)

With the economy still in recovery mode and the coronavirus pandemic still raging, Donald Trump appears to be struggling. 
 
But could he really become a one-term president?
 
Here, we look at the last two White House incumbents who lost their re-election bids, Jimmy Carter and George H W Bush, to see what went wrong for them and what President Trump could learn. 
 
With interviews with historian Rick Perlstein, Monmouth University Polling Institute’s director Patrick Murray and former GOP strategist Tara Setmayer.

Finland and Denmark have consistently topped the United Nations’ most prestigious index, The World Happiness Report, in all six areas of life satisfaction: income, healthy life expectancy, social support, freedom, trust and generosity.

Learn more about work-life balance secrets from the happiest countries in the world on CNBC Make It: https://cnb.cx/37So3YY

Each year, a group of happiness experts from around the globe rank 156 countries based on how “happy” citizens are, and they publish their findings in the World Happiness Report. Happiness might seem like an elusive concept to quantify, but there is a science to it.

When researchers talk about “happiness,” they’re referring to “satisfaction with the way one’s life is going,” Jeff Sachs, co-creator of the World Happiness Report and a professor at Columbia University, tells CNBC Make It.

“It’s not primarily a measure of whether one laughed or smiled yesterday, but how one feels about the course of one’s life,” he says.

Since the report began in 2012, Nordic countries — which include Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland, plus the Faroe Islands, Greenland and Aland — consistently turn up at the top of the list. (The United States, on the other hand, typically lands somewhere around 18th or 19th place.)

Reason is the planet's leading source of news, politics, and culture from a libertarian perspective. Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.

That proposition was the subject of a November 5, 2019, debate hosted by the Soho Forum, a monthly debate series sponsored by Reason. Arguing in favor of the resolution was Richard D. Wolff, an economist at the University of Massachusetts and the author, most recently, of Understanding Marxism. Taking the other side was former Barron's economics editor Gene Epstein, who is also the Soho Forum's co-founder and director. Reason's Nick Gillespie served as moderator.

It was an Oxford-style debate, in which the audience votes on the resolution at the beginning and end of the event; the side that gains the most ground is victorious. It was a packed house, with about 450 people in attendance. The pre-debate vote found that 25 percent of the audience agreed that socialism was preferable to capitalism, 49.5 percent picked capitalism as the better system, and 25.5 percent were undecided. Despite a technical problem at the event itself, the Soho Forum was able to recover the final vote totals, which saw support for socialism drop by half a percentage point and support for capitalism increase to 71 percent.

Some in the industry are working to make standard fission power safer and cheaper. Others are pursuing the holy grail of energy - nuclear fusion, the process that powers the sun and the stars. If we figure out how to harness that power here on earth, it would be a huge game-changer.

QIt8WuEQntY,CNBC,UCvJJ_dzjViJCoLf5uKUTwoA,1582376326.0,How Elon Musk Took Tesla To Hell And Back With The Model 3,"In 2003, a Silicon Valley startup called Tesla Motors came up with an ambitious plan that would transform the auto industry. Founders Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning set out to redefine the electric car. Cars that everyone would want— affordable, environmentally friendly and fast. Their master plan started with a low volume of expensive but alluring electric sports cars. 

In 2004, well-known entrepreneur and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk invested millions of his own money and eventually became CEO. In less than 10 years, Tesla released the groundbreaking Roadster, Model S and Model X, all paving the way for its first affordable electric car, the Model 3. By 2016, Musk and Tesla looked unstoppable.

Over the next year, the company struggled to simply make cars. Tesla was plagued by manufacturing woes, financial losses, a controversial SolarCity acquisition and volatile decision making from its CEO. On top of that, some say Elon Musk was distracted by other projects like the Boring Company and Hyperloop One, was scrutinized for smoking pot on the Joe Rogan Experience, and tweeting that he was taking Tesla private for $420, which led to a SEC lawsuit.

 Elon Musk says growing Tesla from the Roadster to Model 3 was a “hell of a ride,” and he took Wall Street along with him. Here’s the wild story of how Tesla started an EV revolution.

Tuition costs at both public and private universities have doubled since the late 80s, while accounting for inflation.

""I think that it's so ingrained in your head that you have to go to college, that college is the next step after graduation,"" said Jarret Freeman, a college graduate with roughly $50,000 in student debt. ""I think in hindsight, I see that college is not for everyone.""

But a college education is becoming more and more necessary to succeed in today's economy. Georgetown University estimates that by 2020, 65 percent of all jobs will require more than a high school degree.

Students graduate with an average of $37,172 in student loan debt. It all adds up to $1.5 trillion across the country.

Watch the video above to learn how higher education became big business, hear from former students facing mounting debt and explore why it's so important to solve the student debt crisis.» Subscribe to CNBC: http://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC

Kelp is used in medicine, animal feed, fertilizer and even as a biofuel. That's why the commercial seaweed market size could surpass $85 billion by 2026, according to Global Market Insights. Seaweed farmer Bren Smith says all one needs to start in the business is $20,000, twenty acres and a boat, and that investment in a single seaweed farm can net up to $90,000 to $120,000 per year. Here’s why the global demand in seaweed is expected to boom in the coming years.

6Rb2TsOm3Kw,CNBC,UCvJJ_dzjViJCoLf5uKUTwoA,1551996815.0,How JP Morgan Chase Became The Largest Bank In The US,"From the railroad and steel consolidations brokered by John Pierpont Morgan on Wall Street more than a century ago, to banking consolidation, the financial crisis and Jamie Dimon's leadership, J.P. Morgan Chase has been at the center of finance for more than a century. Here's the story of how the country's largest bank got to where it is today.

Biographer of J.P. Morgan Jean Strouse, longtime bank analyst Mike Mayo and CNBC banking reporter Hugh Son help tell the story. You’ll learn about how Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton are part of the bank’s history, along with the first ATM, and the company’s position moving forward into the future of digital banking.

Watch the video above to see how the country’s largest bank got to where it is today.

***Clarification*** Since 2004, investors in JPM stock have outperformed the bank stock index by an average of 6% return every year. That's more than 6x the return of the index yearly (13:52)

In February, J.P. Morgan Chase announced it was in growth mode, expanding its branch network to cover 93 percent of the U.S. population by the end of 2022.

The aggressive growth plans will allow it to reach 80 million more consumers, or about one-quarter of the U.S. population, versus its footprint in 2018, the New York-based bank says.

The expansion of physical branches comes amid a consumer shift to mobile and online banking. The average number of teller transactions per customer has plunged 41 percent since 2014, according to J.P. Morgan's presentation at its investor day meeting.

But convenient branch locations are a key consideration for people thinking about switching banks, and most of the firm's growth in deposits has been fueled by people who use branches frequently, the bank said.

The company made it clear it had flexibility in its growth plans: More than 75 percent of its branches could be shuttered within five years or kept open for more than a decade.

Traditionally used as a means of economic diversification by countries reliant on a single industry, sovereign wealth funds have come under scrutiny as financial organizations like Goldman Sachs and corrupt politicians have taken advantage of these large, mostly unregulated pools of money for their own gain. While Goldman Sachs continues to profit off of sovereign wealth funds in other countries, the bank is currently being investigated for its role in the 1MDB scandal, which could have lasting implications on the world of finance.

QIt8WuEQntY,CNBC,UCvJJ_dzjViJCoLf5uKUTwoA,1582376326.0,How Elon Musk Took Tesla To Hell And Back With The Model 3,"In 2003, a Silicon Valley startup called Tesla Motors came up with an ambitious plan that would transform the auto industry. Founders Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning set out to redefine the electric car. Cars that everyone would want— affordable, environmentally friendly and fast. Their master plan started with a low volume of expensive but alluring electric sports cars. 

In 2004, well-known entrepreneur and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk invested millions of his own money and eventually became CEO. In less than 10 years, Tesla released the groundbreaking Roadster, Model S and Model X, all paving the way for its first affordable electric car, the Model 3. By 2016, Musk and Tesla looked unstoppable.

Over the next year, the company struggled to simply make cars. Tesla was plagued by manufacturing woes, financial losses, a controversial SolarCity acquisition and volatile decision making from its CEO. On top of that, some say Elon Musk was distracted by other projects like the Boring Company and Hyperloop One, was scrutinized for smoking pot on the Joe Rogan Experience, and tweeting that he was taking Tesla private for $420, which led to a SEC lawsuit.

 Elon Musk says growing Tesla from the Roadster to Model 3 was a “hell of a ride,” and he took Wall Street along with him. Here’s the wild story of how Tesla started an EV revolution.

On March 9, 2016, the worlds of Go and artificial intelligence collided in South Korea for an extraordinary best-of-five-game competition, coined The DeepMind Challenge Match. Hundreds of millions of people around the world watched as a legendary Go master took on an unproven AI challenger for the first time in history.

Directed by Greg Kohs and with an original score by Academy Award nominee Hauschka, AlphaGo chronicles a journey from the halls of Oxford, through the backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of DeepMind in London, and ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds, more questions emerge: What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game? What can it teach us about humanity?",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WXuK6gekU1Y/hqdefault.jpg,2020-11-02 18:55:36.414136,Neutral,0.0,['None'],Neutral,False,1,e9yK1QndJSM,1,Edward Snowden

Jeff Bezos is not only the richest man in the world, he has built a business that is without precedent in the history of American capitalism. His power to shape everything from the future of work to the future of commerce to the future of technology is unrivaled. As politicians and regulators around the world start to consider the global impact of Amazon — and how to rein in Bezos’ power — FRONTLINE investigates how he executed a plan to build one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world.

His decisions about buying shares and companies have beaten the stock market year after year and made him the richest person in the world - thought to be worth 37 billion dollars.

Yet Buffett lives modestly in his native Omaha, in America's mid-West, and runs his 150 billion dollar business with a staff of just twenty.

He talks to Buffett's family, friends and colleagues about the man they call the Sage of Omaha, and Buffett's friend Bill Gates praises his philosophy of life.

RFxXl9eAWV4,Yahoo Finance,UCEAZeUIeJs0IjQiqTCdVSIg,1557456068.0,Charlie Munger's advice on investing and life choices that make a person wealthy,"As Berkshire's Vice Chairman, the 95-year-old Munger is Warren Buffett's right-hand man. He's also an investing legend in his own right. Munger ran a firm in the 1960s and '70s that scored returns of over 24% per year. He's here to talk about how to make investment decisions and life choices that help secure prosperity and longevity.

I'm Andy Serwer. Welcome to ""Influencers."" And welcome to our guest, Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Charlie Munger. Charlie, nice to see you.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Delighted to be here.

ANDY SERWER: So you just had the annual meeting. And I have to ask you what your favorite moments of that were.

CHARLIE MUNGER: What I like is that both the shareholders and employees of Berkshire are so extremely enthusiastic. And it's not just that they made a lot of money and have nice careers. They think they're on the right side.

ANDY SERWER: And, you know, they come there to hear you guys talk all day. And--

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, it's like a cult.

ANDY SERWER: It's like a cult?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah.

ANDY SERWER: In a good way, though?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, a good cult. Yeah, it's a good cult.

ANDY SERWER: OK. I mean, and the stuff that they hear-- some of it's new, some of it's old, and a lot of it is common sense. And you were talking a lot about--

CHARLIE MUNGER: All of it is common sense.

ANDY SERWER: Right.

CHARLIE MUNGER: But of course, when people use the word ""common sense,"" what they mean is uncommon sense. Because the standard human condition is ignorance and stupidity. And when they say, old Joe has common sense, what they mean is he has uncommon sense.

ANDY SERWER: I guess it's a bit of a misnomer then.

CHARLIE MUNGER: It really is.

ANDY SERWER: So, yeah, why is it that people can't think clearly about investing or decisions in their lives?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, they don't think very well about sex or gambling either. You know, I think the standard human condition has a lot of miscognition.

ANDY SERWER: And there are ways to make hay of that or--

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes. You take advantage of other people. You can improve your own life by eliminating your miscognitions.

ANDY SERWER: Let me shift gears a little bit, Charlie, and ask you about the US economy. And what is your take on where things are right now?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, obviously, they're booming. But, you know, the economy sometimes booms, and sometimes it doesn't. And you have to live your life through both episodes. And our idea is we just keep swimming. And sometimes the tide is with us, and sometimes against. But we keep swimming either way.

ANDY SERWER: Are you surprised by how long this expansion has lasted?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Of course, it's lasted a long time. But what was really remarkable is that we never printed money so much and spent it so fast and bought back so much debt, public and private. So this is total terra incognita in economics. And nobody knew for sure how it was going to work.

ANDY SERWER: So was it risky then?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Of course it was risky. But it worked. And I don't think they had much else that it would work. They weren't set up to do stimulus-- too much controversy. Democratic inertia is very thin. So they had to do something. And all they had left was just to print money and start buying things. And that's what they did. And it turned out to be a very wise response. And what's even more remarkable is that both Congress and the presidency and both parties made the same decision. They all cooperated. It was the last time.

His $82.5 billion fortune makes him the third richest person in the world. And he's vowed to give nearly all of it away. The Oracle of Omaha is here to talk about what shaped his investment strategy and how to master today's market.

I'm Andy Serwer. Welcome to a special edition of ""Influencers"" from Omaha, Nebraska. It's my pleasure to welcome Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Warren, welcome.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thanks for coming.

ANDY SERWER: So let's start off and talk about the economy a little bit. And obviously, we've been on a good long run here.

WARREN BUFFETT: A very long run.

ANDY SERWER: And does that surprise you? And what would be the signs that you would look for to see that things were winding down?

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I look at a lot of figures just in connection with our businesses. I like to get numbers. So I'm getting reports in weekly in some businesses, but that doesn't tell me what the economy's going to six months from now or three months from now. It tells me what's going on now with our businesses. And it really doesn't make any difference in what I do today in terms of buying stocks or buying businesses what those numbers tell me. They're interesting, but they're not guides to me.

RFxXl9eAWV4,Yahoo Finance,UCEAZeUIeJs0IjQiqTCdVSIg,1557456068.0,Charlie Munger's advice on investing and life choices that make a person wealthy,"As Berkshire's Vice Chairman, the 95-year-old Munger is Warren Buffett's right-hand man. He's also an investing legend in his own right. Munger ran a firm in the 1960s and '70s that scored returns of over 24% per year. He's here to talk about how to make investment decisions and life choices that help secure prosperity and longevity.

I'm Andy Serwer. Welcome to ""Influencers."" And welcome to our guest, Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Charlie Munger. Charlie, nice to see you.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Delighted to be here.

ANDY SERWER: So you just had the annual meeting. And I have to ask you what your favorite moments of that were.

CHARLIE MUNGER: What I like is that both the shareholders and employees of Berkshire are so extremely enthusiastic. And it's not just that they made a lot of money and have nice careers. They think they're on the right side.

ANDY SERWER: And, you know, they come there to hear you guys talk all day. And--

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, it's like a cult.

ANDY SERWER: It's like a cult?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah.

ANDY SERWER: In a good way, though?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, a good cult. Yeah, it's a good cult.

ANDY SERWER: OK. I mean, and the stuff that they hear-- some of it's new, some of it's old, and a lot of it is common sense. And you were talking a lot about--

CHARLIE MUNGER: All of it is common sense.

ANDY SERWER: Right.

CHARLIE MUNGER: But of course, when people use the word ""common sense,"" what they mean is uncommon sense. Because the standard human condition is ignorance and stupidity. And when they say, old Joe has common sense, what they mean is he has uncommon sense.

ANDY SERWER: I guess it's a bit of a misnomer then.

CHARLIE MUNGER: It really is.

ANDY SERWER: So, yeah, why is it that people can't think clearly about investing or decisions in their lives?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, they don't think very well about sex or gambling either. You know, I think the standard human condition has a lot of miscognition.

ANDY SERWER: And there are ways to make hay of that or--

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes. You take advantage of other people. You can improve your own life by eliminating your miscognitions.

ANDY SERWER: Let me shift gears a little bit, Charlie, and ask you about the US economy. And what is your take on where things are right now?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, obviously, they're booming. But, you know, the economy sometimes booms, and sometimes it doesn't. And you have to live your life through both episodes. And our idea is we just keep swimming. And sometimes the tide is with us, and sometimes against. But we keep swimming either way.

ANDY SERWER: Are you surprised by how long this expansion has lasted?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Of course, it's lasted a long time. But what was really remarkable is that we never printed money so much and spent it so fast and bought back so much debt, public and private. So this is total terra incognita in economics. And nobody knew for sure how it was going to work.

ANDY SERWER: So was it risky then?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Of course it was risky. But it worked. And I don't think they had much else that it would work. They weren't set up to do stimulus-- too much controversy. Democratic inertia is very thin. So they had to do something. And all they had left was just to print money and start buying things. And that's what they did. And it turned out to be a very wise response. And what's even more remarkable is that both Congress and the presidency and both parties made the same decision. They all cooperated. It was the last time.

AIYPu4MFLl4,Yahoo Finance,UCEAZeUIeJs0IjQiqTCdVSIg,1550214976.0,Charlie Munger calls Elon Musk 'brilliant' and bitcoin 'stupid and immoral',"ANDY SERWER: I'm here with Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. Charlie, great to see you. 

CHARLIE MUNGER: Nice to be here. 

ANDY SERWER: I want to continue with some of the questions that people were asking you at the annual meeting and start maybe with China, and trade and tariffs. And you said that even Trump can be right on some of this stuff. 

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes, when people get mad enough at one politician, they get to thinking everything he says and does is wrong, and that's never the case. 

ANDY SERWER: What, what, go ahead and continue. I'm sorry. 

CHARLIE MUNGER: And all I said was that you don't want to be such an absolute purist for free trade. I'm almost a purist, but not quite, but I wouldn't want the entire steel industry in the United States to move offshore. There's some place where you could draw a line without ruining the world. 

ANDY SERWER: What should our trade policy be then? I mean, yes China can be unfair, is unfair, but how should we pursue this? 

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, attitudes entirely different from our president's. I'm glad that we ran a big trade deficit with China. That enabled them to rapidly get out of poverty and obscurity. I welcome the Chinese to the group of advanced nations, which I think we enabled considerably by our willingness to trade with them as they moved ever upward in terms of complexity of enterprise. 

So I like what's happened. I don't regard it as unfair and bad. I'm not saying that it would be unthinkable to have some tariffs somewhere, but basically I'm a free trader and I am particularly a free trader in dealing with China. And I like the fact that free trade with China has enabled China to expand so much, and they got out of poverty. 

They had hundreds of millions of people in rural poverty and they made huge, in the whole history of the world, no big nation has ever advanced faster than China. And this free trade helped them do it. And I like it. 

ANDY SERWER: But aren't they unfair to us? Just to follow up on, you know, intellectual property. 

CHARLIE MUNGER: I'm sure there are places where somebody in China has some advantage over somebody in the United States that you and I might not like perfectly, but that will always happen. But basically, the Chinese broke the Berkshire Hathaway shoe business in Maine. It disappeared basically because their shoes were very good and cheaper. 

I'm not mad at China over that and Berkshire has prospered. It's not so good for Maine, but we can't help it. There's no way to make an advanced civilization never hurt anybody as it evolves. 

ANDY SERWER: There's a lot of talk about an elephant that Berkshire is on the hunt for a big acquisition. Could that elephant be in China.? And if it was, could you even buy it given the relationship between the two countries right now? 

CHARLIE MUNGER: I don't think it's likely that we'll be buying any great Chinese companies. The Chinese are very proud of their companies and they're proud of what they've accomplished. What I consider quite likely is that we will be invited to buy part of some great Chinese company. And just because they like the good company. And I think that is very likely to happen some time, and we would welcome it. We own minority positions in a lot of companies. We own a minority position in BYD. 

ANDY SERWER: Let me ask you, then, about BYD and Chinese cars. When will Chinese cars be allowed in the United States and what's holding it up, is it bureaucracy? 

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well the auto market is very competitive and very fully occupied. And of course, nobody in the United States wants to lose our last two big domestic suppliers, manufacturers of autos. Well three if you want to count Ferrari Chrysler. And so it's hard for somebody new to come in the American market big. And China has such a big market of its own. My guess is they'll stay busy in their own part of the world for a long time. 

ANDY SERWER: So that's not a priority for BYD? 

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well BYD's biggest advantage is in the electric cars. Where they're so close to the cutting edge of battery technology. And so they'd be crazy not to emphasize the hybrid electric cars over the gasoline cars. Not that they'll go out of the gasoline market, but I think they will be biggest in the hybrid and electric cars.

As a result, budget and pay cuts have since pushed police officers toward better paying opportunities outside the city, and private security companies have rushed into the city.

Now, private security is a booming industry in Detroit. The largest contractor has reported 25% year-over-year growth since the city’s bankruptcy.

VICE News spoke to Dale Brown, an ex-army paratrooper, who began teaching his own brand of self-defense in the early '90s and started his own Detroit-based security company called Threat Management Center in 2000. Brown says his 60-person VIPER force has more than 5,000 private citizens as clients along with 100 businesses. Altogether, the company brings in about two million dollars a year.

As the nation gears up for the presidential election, the ABC’s US Bureau Chief David Lipson takes us on a road trip through the northeast swing states to talk to ordinary people about the coming contest.  
 
Trump’s re-election looked like a certainty before the pandemic. Now, with the economy buckling under more lockdowns, COVID cases rising and civil unrest running in the streets, his grip on power looks more tenuous. 
 
As fringe groups arm themselves for conflict, will this fractured country survive the ultimate democratic stress-test? 
 
David meets Phil from the Michigan Liberty Militia who’s angry about his state’s lockdown orders describing them as ‘a stomp on our constitutional rights’. In protest, the Michigan Patriots Militia took control of the State parliament in April. Now Phil warns a Trump defeat could get ugly. 
 
‘There's a lot people out there that would not be able to handle that… there is people… that just think Trump is…like a God.” 
 
‘Bikers for Trump’ member Londa has kept her faith in Trump and is banking on him to deliver the prosperity America used to enjoy.  
 
‘He doesn’t care what anybody thinks. He’s doing what’s best for the country.’   
 
In middle-class Ohio, a professional soccer mum with six children says she’s changed her mind about Trump because he’s ‘unkind’.  
 
‘It's just not the way that I would want my kids to be treating anybody ”. 
 
In Detroit, once the engine of America’s car industry, Dave meets African American woman Desha. She watched her husband die a painful death from COVID-19 and is now urging African Americans to come out and vote on election day.    
 
“Gotta do it. Like we have to, you have to, it is so much more important, you know, now than ever before.”

By March 10, there were already over 8,500 cases. Under massive pressure to stop the pandemic from spreading in prisons, the government was forced to make another unprecedented decision – they released more than 200 Mafia members from high-security prisons.

For prosecutors and investigators, this decision walked back decades of hard work. For the mafia, it came at a perfect moment. The coronavirus has not only offered new business opportunities such as selling masks but also has sent Italy spiraling toward complete economic collapse, leaving the most vulnerable Italians with no option but to turn to the mob. 

VICE News goes to Naples, Italy to see how the mafia has used the pandemic to tighten their grip on Italy.

A group of armed pro-Trump and militia activists marched to the City Hall in Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday. They were confronted by Black Lives Matter  counter-protesters.

Rival protesters were filmed verbally confronting each other before police officers showed up prompting militia leader Dylan Stevens, known as the Angry Viking, to say his group was leaving the area.

Armed militias were present in various locations across the country during the recent protests against racism and police brutality.

In late August, two people were shot dead and several others injured in Kenosha, Wisconsin, after a civilian armed with a rifle opened fire on demonstrators.

In recent years, a small amount of hackers and gamers have been anonymously reporting fake hostage situations, shootings, and other violent crimes designed to send elite police units, like SWAT teams, to unsuspecting people at their residences.

Swatting is a dangerous and expensive prank, which is easy to pull off. Swatters are utilizing easily accessible technology to mask or even alter the ID during calls to 911 dispatchers. With SWAT teams and paramilitary gear becoming the norm across small town America, these calls have predictably chaotic results.

Despite the hyper-vigilance of America's law enforcement, authorities still struggle to defend themselves from the unlikeliest of threats — tech-savvy teenagers. Police militarization meets hacker culture as VICE News investigates the dangerous crime of swatting.

Simon meets with an elite task force, tasked with helping rid their state of drug cartels. He also learns of how this state is using clean energy to renew it's decimated economy. 

Simon Reeve continues his journey through the Americas. In this second leg, Simon is in the United States travelling down the Rocky Mountains from Montana to Colorado. In the wide-open prairies of Montana, the cowboy way of life is under threat from a long-term decline in the rural economy, but Simon meets a former Silicon Valley executive who has envisaged a new future for the land. The hugely ambitious American Prairie Reserve is attempting to turn three million acres of former ranches, farms and public lands into a protected habitat for America’s wildlife, reintroducing iconic species long extinct, including the North American bison. It is a move being welcomed by native American groups still living under the shadow of historical injustice.

The high walls, electric fences, and private security guards surrounding South Africa's residences and businesses are as inherent to the country's landscape as Table Mountain is to Cape Town. And with good reason — South Africa's 2012-2013 crime statistics were the worst in a decade, with increases in murder, attempted murder, violent armed robbery, and carjackings.

Fear of crime has led to a boom in South Africa's private security industry since apartheid ended 20 years ago. The field's quick expansion is largely a result of continued social and economic inequality, increased violence, and inept police forces.

VICE News traveled to South Africa's mother city Cape Town to look at the lifestyle gap between those who can and cannot afford the luxury of safety.

EP88_mNK3-U,VICE,UCn8zNIfYAQNdrFRrr8oibKw,1489218167.0,How Police Departments Use Civil Forfeiture to Collect Billions,"Based on laws that originated from the War on Drugs in the 1980s, police departments around the country are able to seize a person’s cash and property without charging them with a crime.  

Civil forfeiture laws were created as a tool to cripple suspected criminals and drug rings, but police departments nationwide have been using this cash and property to fund their operations or even pay policemen directly. 

The problem, is that in the vast majority of assets seizures, the individual is not charged with a crime. And once their cash and property are seized, getting it back is a prohibitively lengthy and expensive process.

Desperate, the government urged anyone to get to the front and fight the Russian-backed separatists. As the war drags on, Ukraine claims their military is now in control and the volunteers have all been disbanded. But we tracked down some rogue volunteers still out there fighting, not prepared to hand over their weapons anytime soon.

waeMkka60po,VICE News,UCZaT_X_mc0BI-djXOlfhqWQ,1394863321.0,Permanently Temporary: The Truth About Temp Labor (Full Length),"Temp labor is one of the fastest growing industries in the US. Increasingly, temp workers are part of a business strategy to keep costs down and profits high. From mega-retailers to mom-and-pop shops, temps are hired to do some of the hardest and most dangerous jobs. While more and more of the American workforce is comprised of temporary workers, they're largely hidden from public view. Many of these workers stay silent, often having their livelihoods threatened if they speak out. 

Wanting to get a glimpse of this invisible workforce, VICE News traveled across the country, scouring warehouses, temp agencies, and temp towns in search of the people, who make our world of same day delivery possible.

For more from VICE News on the plight of temp labor in the US, read ""A Modern Day Harvest of Shame"" here: https://news.vice.com/articles/the-modern-day-harvest-of-shame

This story was developed in collaboration with reporting by Propublica -- http://www.propublica.org/series/temp-land.

Vice takes an unprecedented look into the shadowy industry of Private Military Companies.  For the past two decades these private companies, like Black Water, Aegis and G4S have silently consumed military operations around the world, doing everything from back end logistics, protection of government VIP's and diplomats to actual combat duties.  In this documentary we explore the origins of this industry, their rise in the war on terror and their future operations around the world.

G2_5rPbUDNA,VICE News,UCZaT_X_mc0BI-djXOlfhqWQ,1519452721.0,This Is How Easy It Is To Get Hacked | VICE on HBO,"Since the 2016 election, the notion of hacking has become inextricably intertwined with one country: Russia.

But cyber crimes emanating from Russia and Russian speaking countries have been around for years, fueling attacks like a 2014 data breach of more than 500 million Yahoo! accounts and a scheme that stole 160 million credit cards from American corporations.

""If someone wants to hack you, they're gonna be able to"" former NSA hacker Patrick Wardle told VICE News. And if a Russian wants to hack you, they've certainly got the tools: A 2016 report by the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that 75 percent of all ransomware was created in Russia.

The apparent lack of ethical consideration in the buildup of Russian information technology and cyber security is rooted in decades of technical education under Stalin, who launched polytechnic schools to train engineers for his military-industrial complex. Russia's cyber capabilities can now be used for just about everything, ranging from digital bank robberies to tampering with critical infrastructure.

""This is the website of a big online store."" Kostya, an anonymous Russian hacker who agreed to show VICE News how easy it is to steal digital data. ""I can get into their configurations and download their client database.""

Spurred by the trillions of dollars online and in a generation raised on the web, hacking from Russia and around the world is flourishing.

VICE News went to Moscow to see the country’s expert hackers in action.

But when a teen sexual assault committed by two members of the football team surfaced, the shadowy hacker group Anonymous caught wind of the story and decided to intervene. After publishing videos and social media from the night of the assault to their millions of online followers, they sparked viral outrage and demands for #JusticeforJaneDoe. They unleashed a passionate mob and their actions divided the small town,but in the process gave strength to generations of women forced to hide abuse. This film asks, when it seems like nothing will change, when is it OK for outsiders to intervene?

The world is already feeling the effects of climate change, and it stands to get much worse if immediate action isn't taken to curb warming emissions, scientists warn. Projections show climate change could cause as much as $44 trillion in damage over the next five decades. And in the U.S., as many as 100 million Americans live in coastal cities and towns where rising sea levels pose a risk to residential and business properties.

Some cities are taking matters into their own hands. Miami Beach, for example, launched a nearly half a billion-dollar project in 2015 to pump water off the streets, in an effort to combat the rising seas.

As the costs mount, so do allegations that powerful interests in the oil and gas industry, like ExxonMobil, purposefully misled the public about climate science and delayed corrective measures.

VICE News followed the money to see the true economic stakes of climate change and decades of denial.

The event went on to become a viral meme. Harnessing the sensational momentum, the storming event was transformed into a music festival that was set to take place in the rural town of Rachel, Nevada. 

Power struggles behind the scenes, however, created chaos and confusion for both the media and those who wanted to attend. 

VICE producers Zeke Spector and Dan Zabludovsky documented their process of trying to gain access to the event and their attempt to make sense of how an Internet entity can affect people in the real world.

On March 9, 2016, the worlds of Go and artificial intelligence collided in South Korea for an extraordinary best-of-five-game competition, coined The DeepMind Challenge Match. Hundreds of millions of people around the world watched as a legendary Go master took on an unproven AI challenger for the first time in history.

Directed by Greg Kohs and with an original score by Academy Award nominee Hauschka, AlphaGo chronicles a journey from the halls of Oxford, through the backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of DeepMind in London, and ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds, more questions emerge: What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game? What can it teach us about humanity?",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WXuK6gekU1Y/hqdefault.jpg,2020-11-02 18:55:50.258598,Neutral,0.0,['None'],Neutral,True,4,waeMkka60po,2,Proud Boys

The second season of WIRED’s Future Cities series takes us inside one of the world’s biggest startup nations.

WIRED’s four-part series will look beyond Tel Aviv’s vibrant, liberal tech epicentre to the wider Holy Land region – the Palestinian territories, where a parallel Startup Nation story is emerging in East Jerusalem, Ramallah and the West Bank, as well as in the Israeli cybersecurity hub of Beersheba. And we will learn how the fertile innovation ecosystem of Silicon Wadi has evolved as a result of its unique political, geographical and cultural situation and explore the future challenges – and solutions – these nations are facing.

FUTURE CITIES | SERIES 1 - SHENZHEN:
We examine the unique manufacturing ecosystem that has emerged, gaining access to the world’s leading hardware-prototyping culture whilst challenging misconceptions from the west. The film looks at how the evolution of “Shanzhai” – or copycat manufacturing – has transformed traditional models of business, distribution and innovation, and asks what the rest of the world can learn from this so-called “Silicon Valley of hardware"".

NXaVLXSZdEw,DW Documentary,UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,1559860754.0,Germany: The discreet lives of the super rich | DW Documentary,"The rich in Germany been never been as well-off as they are today and assets have never been so unevenly distributed. But who are they? How do they live? And what do they think of their country? A journey into the discreet world of the super-rich.

One percent of Germans own over a quarter of the country's assets, whilst half of the country’s citizens have no assets at all. But while the German media report on the growing poverty in the country on a daily basis, little is known about the super-rich. They keep a very low profile and can walk the streets unrecognized. ""Manager Magazin” says there were around 200 billionaires living in Germany in 2018, and their numbers are increasing. The documentary ""Top of the World"" asks why rich Germans are so unwilling to talk about their wealth. Its author immerses himself in the discreet world of big money and meets financial advisors with 800 years of family tradition behind them and billionaires such as drugstore king Dirk Rossmann and mail-order company heir Michael Otto -  as well as a self-made businessmen such as Rainer Schaller. They talk about their notions of money and justice, the origins of their wealth and their fear of social envy.

Milking cows is a dirty, monotonous job, and as we found out in our latest episode of Immigrant America, it's not a job many unemployed Americans are willing to do. But for some reason the government doesn't give dairy farms a way to recruit foreign workers legally, so most feel forced to hire illegal immigrants. This makes the farms and their workers easy targets for immigration authorities looking to fill deportation quotas. We went to upstate New York to try to understand the cat and mouse game going on between dairy farms and immigration authorities. We found a lot of wasted taxpayer money, racial profiling, and a broken system that unnecessarily treats family farmers and hardworking immigrants like criminals.

Some call it a useful dowry of evolution, others a fault in the human genetic make-up: The old mortal sin Greed seems to be more ubiquitous than ever. Why can't people ever get enough, where is this self-indulgence leading - and are there any ways out of this vicious circle of gratification?

""People like to have a lot of stuff because it makes them the feeling of living forever,"" says American social psychologist Sheldon Solomon, who believes today's materialism and consumerism will have disastrous consequences.

Anyone who fails to satisfy his or her desires in this age of the Ego is deemed a loser. But with more than 7 billion people on the Earth, the ramifications of this excessive consumption of resources are already clear. Isn’t the deplorable state of our planet proof enough that ""The Greed Program,"" which has made us crave possessions, status and power, is coming to an end? Or is the frenzied search for more and more still an indispensable part of our nature? We set off to look for the essence of greed. And we tell the stories of people who - whether as perpetrators or victims or even just as willing consumers - have become accomplices in a sea change in values.

Joe Biden has renewed his attack on President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic ahead of the presidential election on 3 November.

The Democratic candidate told the debate in Nashville, Tennessee: ""Anyone who's responsible for that many deaths should not remain president of the United States of America.

""He says we're, you know, learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it.""

Mr Trump responded by saying: ""We're rounding the corner. It's going away,"" adding that ""we can't close up our nation or we won't have one"".
