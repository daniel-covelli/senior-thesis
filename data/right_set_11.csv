This is because companies are set to restructure their employees' salary packages to align them with new wage rules proposed by the government. According to the draft rules, part of the Code on Wages 2019, the allowances component of an employee's gross pay - or total cost to company (CTC) - cannot exceed 50 per cent of the total compensation. The basic salary has to be 50 per cent of total pay. Changes in the take-home salary are hot topics of discussion and a sensitive one at that. On FYI, we declutter that for you.

Over 40 million people in the United States live below the poverty line, twice as many as it was fifty years ago. It can happen very quickly.


Many people in the United States fall through the social safety net. In the structurally weak mining region of the Appalachians, it has become almost normal for people to go shopping with food stamps. And those who lose their home often have no choice but to live in a car. There are so many homeless people in Los Angeles that relief organizations have started to build small wooden huts to provide them with a roof over their heads. The number of homeless children has also risen dramatically, reaching 1.5 million, three times more than during the Great Depression the 1930s. A documentary about the fate of the poor in the United States today.

We closed the commentary section because of too many inapproriate comments.

Over 40 million people in the United States live below the poverty line, twice as many as it was fifty years ago. It can happen very quickly.


Many people in the United States fall through the social safety net. In the structurally weak mining region of the Appalachians, it has become almost normal for people to go shopping with food stamps. And those who lose their home often have no choice but to live in a car. There are so many homeless people in Los Angeles that relief organizations have started to build small wooden huts to provide them with a roof over their heads. The number of homeless children has also risen dramatically, reaching 1.5 million, three times more than during the Great Depression the 1930s. A documentary about the fate of the poor in the United States today.

We closed the commentary section because of too many inapproriate comments.

Over 40 million people in the United States live below the poverty line, twice as many as it was fifty years ago. It can happen very quickly.


Many people in the United States fall through the social safety net. In the structurally weak mining region of the Appalachians, it has become almost normal for people to go shopping with food stamps. And those who lose their home often have no choice but to live in a car. There are so many homeless people in Los Angeles that relief organizations have started to build small wooden huts to provide them with a roof over their heads. The number of homeless children has also risen dramatically, reaching 1.5 million, three times more than during the Great Depression the 1930s. A documentary about the fate of the poor in the United States today.

We closed the commentary section because of too many inapproriate comments.

nIjaLmOTkEE,Sky News Australia,UCO0akufu9MOzyz3nvGIXAAw,1602771611.0,NY Post to 'release bombshell expose' linking Hunter Biden to Chinese business deals,"Miranda Devine says The New York Post will tomorrow release even more bombshell evidence linking Hunter Biden to Chinese business dealings after they obtained leaked emails and photographs from the hard-drive of Hunter's laptop.

The New York Post today released an expose detailing links between Joe Biden and his son who was paid at least $50,000 a month to sit on the board of a Ukrainian energy company who allegedly set up a meeting with the Vice President.

""Hunter Biden is an individual with serious drug problems, he's admitted this, he was drummed out of a post he held in the naval reserve his father procured for him after three months, in his 40s, because of cocaine use,"" Ms Devine said.

""This is not someone you would expect foreign companies to pay millions of dollars to when he has no experience, for instance, in an energy company or no real skills other than influence with his father.""

Ms Devine cited attempts by Twitter and Facebook to ""smother"" the story, by locking the NY Post's account, for malicious and damaging content, while Facebook claimed they were removing the article to fact-check it.

""These are the two big tech companies, multi-national companies, some of the biggest companies in the world and they are interfering in the US election, she said. 

""It's three weeks out from the election, and Joe Biden is the Democratic Presidential candidate,

""These are emails linking Joe Biden to his family's cash-for-influence scandal. This is a Biden family grift. This is the first time there has been an actual, physical, evidential link, between Joe Biden and his son and his brother's business dealings overseas.""",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nIjaLmOTkEE/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-21 14:43:13.154746,Right,1.3333333333333333,"['PartisanRight', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanRight']",Right,False,1,xqsdqkq52AI,1,Jack Dorsey

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, questioned Judge Amy Coney Barrett on Oct. 14, the third day of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing. During his line of questioning, he criticized Democrats’ “assault on the Federalist Society” and its efforts to appoint conservative judges like Barrett to the federal bench. Cruz also said policy disputes over issues such as health care and school choice are best handled by the legislature, rather than the judiciary. “It’s not a judge’s role” to mandate policies favored by either Republicans or Democrats, he argued. Lastly, he expressed concern over the idea of “packing the court” with more justices, a move that is favored by some progressives but has not been endorsed by top Democrats or the party’s presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden. The hearing came about three weeks before Election Day. The third of four days of scheduled testimony gave senators another opportunity to ask Barrett about her record and approach to the law.

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., questioned Judge Amy Coney Barrett on Oct. 14, the third day of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing. Hawley asked about a plethora of federal cases and rulings and criticized what he described as Democrats’ attempt to equate Barrett with the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, whose judicial philosophy she said she shares. Hawley said he was confident Barrett would make her own decisions when on the court, independent of Scalia’s judicial philosophy and her own personal beliefs and convictions. “There’s nothing wrong with confirming to the Supreme Court of the United States a devout, Catholic, pro-life Christian,” Hawley concluded. The hearing came about three weeks before Election Day. The third of four days of scheduled testimony gave senators another opportunity to ask Barrett about her record and approach to the law.

bMiZbjUEjy4,PBS NewsHour,UC6ZFN9Tx6xh-skXCuRHCDpQ,1602716440.0,WATCH: Sen. Ted Cruz questions Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett,"Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, questioned Judge Amy Coney Barrett on Oct. 14, the third day of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing. During his line of questioning, he criticized Democrats’ “assault on the Federalist Society” and its efforts to appoint conservative judges like Barrett to the federal bench. Cruz also said policy disputes over issues such as health care and school choice are best handled by the legislature, rather than the judiciary. “It’s not a judge’s role” to mandate policies favored by either Republicans or Democrats, he argued. Lastly, he expressed concern over the idea of “packing the court” with more justices, a move that is favored by some progressives but has not been endorsed by top Democrats or the party’s presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden. The hearing came about three weeks before Election Day. The third of four days of scheduled testimony gave senators another opportunity to ask Barrett about her record and approach to the law.

wH8J477_L28,CNBC Television,UCrp_UI8XtuYfpiqluWLD7Lw,1602911673.0,Watch the top moments from Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court confirmation hearings,"The Senate confirmation hearings for Judge Amy Coney Barrett concluded Thursday. Here are some of Judge Barrett's most attention grabbing answers from the proceedings. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi 

The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday scheduled an Oct. 22 vote on whether to approve Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court in a rowdy hearing in which Democrats made procedural objections and said the rush to confirm the nominee was unprecedented.

As the hearing unfolded in Washington, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly said in Kentucky that the Senate had the votes to confirm Barrett to the high court, essentially assuring that the efforts by Democrats to delay her confirmation will be unsuccessful.

McConnell, who was in his home state to cast his ballot, said he expects to bring Barrett’s nomination to the Senate floor on Oct. 23, Bloomberg News reported. That time frame would allow her to be seated ahead of the Nov. 3 election between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee.

There was little doubt that Republicans, who hold 53 seats in the Senate, would have the necessary votes, though Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine have objected. Trump has repeatedly pressed for Barrett to be seated in time to resolve any election disputes that arise.

The developments came after Barrett faced two days of intense but civil marathon questioning by senators on the Judiciary Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday. Barrett is expected to be confirmed by the committee by a party line vote, with all 12 Republicans in her favor and 10 Democrats opposed.

Democratic senators tried in vain to derail Thursday’s committee hearing. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., objected to the GOP effort to schedule the vote by noting that he was the only Democrat in the room, and that the rules required at least two members of the minority party to be present.

Committee Chairman Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., pushed on anyway.

“If we create this problem for you in the future, you are going to do what I am going to do, which is move forward with the business of the committee,” Graham told him.

Some Democrats, who had been waiting outside the hearing room, entered and objected to Graham’s move.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said the process was a “rush” and a “sham” and motioned to adjourn the hearing, prompting a round of speeches by members of the committee.

This week, Democrats struggled to explain why Judge Amy Coney Barrett should not be confirmed to serve on the Supreme Court. They trotted out hackneyed arguments, suggesting that some political norm had been broken by a Republican president nominating a judge to be confirmed as a justice by a Republican Senate in an election year. There have been 19 times where a seat became vacant in an election year and both the presidency and Senate were controlled by the same party, resulting in 17 judicial confirmations. They suggested that Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s dying wish to leave her seat open until a Democrat takes power represented a sort of binding legal commitment.

Barrett stressed she has not committed herself to anyone on how she would rule on an election dispute, saying she would commit to consider all factors about whether to recuse herself but she would not allow herself ""to be used as a pawn to decide this election for the American people.""

Asked about her opinion on abortion and the case of Roe v. Wade, she sidestepped questions about whether she agreed with former Justice Antonin Scalia that the case was ""wrongly decided,"" saying she is not going into the court with an ""agenda"" to overturn the case. She also added when asked about the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, that she was ""not on a mission to destroy"" it. 

Democrats have been concerned based on comments by President Donald Trump that Coney Barrett could possibly join other conservative justices on the court and overturn the health care legislation.

John Kennedy, R-L.A., questioned Judge Amy Coney Barrett on the second day of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing. Kennedy asked Barrett about the oath she would take upon confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court, which she said “boils down” to fairly applying the law as well as not giving preferential treatment or expressing bias.
“One of the things about the judicial role that I’ve repeatedly emphasized in the hearing today, is that I’ve got personal views and personal feelings on a range of matters, just like every human does, and just like every judge or justice on the court does,” Barrett said, but emphasized that she takes her oath to applying the law fairly, seriously.
Kennedy also questioned Barrett about her judicial philosophy, particularly as an originalist, or someone who believes that judges “must follow the original public meaning of the Constitution.” She clarified public meaning distinguishes from the “private intentions of those who drafted the document.""
The Oct. 13 hearing comes three weeks before Election Day. The second of four days of scheduled testimony gave senators an opportunity to ask Barrett about her record and approach to the law.

Ben Shapiro is editor-in-chief of The Daily Wire and host of “The Ben Shapiro Show,” the top conservative podcast in the nation. Ben is the New York Times bestselling author of seven nonfiction books and is constantly featured on major newspapers and websites.

Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., questioned Judge Amy Coney Barrett over the Affordable Care Act and voting rights. Klobuchar brought up tweets from President Trump declaring that his nominee would overturn Obamacare. Barrett replied, ""I can't really speak to what the president says on Twitter...I am 100% committed to judicial independence from political pressure."" Barrett also declined to weigh in on whether a Supreme Court ruling that gutted the Voting Rights Act was correctly decided. It's the second day of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing. The Oct. 13 hearing comes three weeks before Election Day. The second of four days of scheduled testimony gave senators an opportunity to ask Barrett about her record and approach to the law.

wH8J477_L28,CNBC Television,UCrp_UI8XtuYfpiqluWLD7Lw,1602911673.0,Watch the top moments from Amy Coney Barrett's Supreme Court confirmation hearings,"The Senate confirmation hearings for Judge Amy Coney Barrett concluded Thursday. Here are some of Judge Barrett's most attention grabbing answers from the proceedings. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi 

The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday scheduled an Oct. 22 vote on whether to approve Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court in a rowdy hearing in which Democrats made procedural objections and said the rush to confirm the nominee was unprecedented.

As the hearing unfolded in Washington, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly said in Kentucky that the Senate had the votes to confirm Barrett to the high court, essentially assuring that the efforts by Democrats to delay her confirmation will be unsuccessful.

McConnell, who was in his home state to cast his ballot, said he expects to bring Barrett’s nomination to the Senate floor on Oct. 23, Bloomberg News reported. That time frame would allow her to be seated ahead of the Nov. 3 election between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee.

There was little doubt that Republicans, who hold 53 seats in the Senate, would have the necessary votes, though Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine have objected. Trump has repeatedly pressed for Barrett to be seated in time to resolve any election disputes that arise.

The developments came after Barrett faced two days of intense but civil marathon questioning by senators on the Judiciary Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday. Barrett is expected to be confirmed by the committee by a party line vote, with all 12 Republicans in her favor and 10 Democrats opposed.

Democratic senators tried in vain to derail Thursday’s committee hearing. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., objected to the GOP effort to schedule the vote by noting that he was the only Democrat in the room, and that the rules required at least two members of the minority party to be present.

Committee Chairman Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., pushed on anyway.

“If we create this problem for you in the future, you are going to do what I am going to do, which is move forward with the business of the committee,” Graham told him.

Some Democrats, who had been waiting outside the hearing room, entered and objected to Graham’s move.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said the process was a “rush” and a “sham” and motioned to adjourn the hearing, prompting a round of speeches by members of the committee.

Known appropriately as “The Beast"", the latest addition to Presidential limo history is decked out with more unique characteristics and countermeasures than we could ever imagine. Each feature is deliberately aimed at keeping the President safe and secure, allowing him to rapidly evade danger during an attack. From tear gas dispensers to nuclear missile launchers, electrified door handles, and walls as thick as that of a 747, in reality, this limo is an indestructible army tank in disguise.

It’s worth $1.5 million, weighs 20,000 pounds, can withstand chemical warfare, and even comes equipped with a fridge full of the president's own blood. Let’s take a look inside, shall we?

I was invited to try out the new Comlux 767BBJ in Zurich. The plane affectionately known as ""SkyLady"" has recently undergone a major refurbishment and upgrade program.

The flight attendant gave me a tour of the large plane. Inside the Comlux 767BBJ SkyLady, the multi-room cabins are divided into 6 independent areas; with a massive ensuite bedroom, a lounge room that can be converted into a second bedroom, a dining and meeting room, First Class, Premium Economy and crew rest area. It can fit up to 51 passengers. 

The plane flew around Switzerland and Northern Italy for around 1.5 hours, with some very nice scenery en-route. I experienced the ultimate luxury in private aviation. A multi-course fine cuisine meal was served by Bijoux catering, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I also enjoyed the super fast 2KU band internet connection on-board.

Besides its comfort and connectivity enhancements, SkyLady is equipped with an all-new ionisation system; this system improves air quality in the cabin, by removing viruses, bacteria and spores in the air and on surfaces and by eliminating annoying and noxious odours.

When it comes to luxurious vehicles, size matters a great deal. Not only does the lack of space restrict movement, but also the opportunity to install equipment. We are often led to believe that American RV manufacturers are the leaders in the production of the biggest most luxurious land vehicles in the world, but let us not forget that there are competitors all around.

Kim Jong Un, the Supreme Leader of North Korea, is a unique executive in global politics. Few dictators wield such absolute power and rule so ruthlessly. He oversees numerous prisons and labor camps, comprised of his political opponents and their families. Because of his human rights infractions and prickly foreign policy, North Korea’s economy is extremely weak. Despite this, he manages to horde the vast majority of the nation’s assets for himself. Today we’re exploring how Kim Jong Un spends his billions.

It was my 40th Birthday and I’ve decided to treat myself for a flight. Flying always makes me happy and there’s no better way to celebrate than flying on Emirates A380 in First Class.

I started my journey at Dubai Airport and met my friend Gerome Gardiner (https://airlinerart.net/) who presented me 2 special Emirates paintings as my birthday gift.  I brought them on-board later to show the crew and have them signed. At Check in, I was registered for Emirates Biometric Path that I no longer need to show passport and boarding pass to enter the lounge or board the flight. It was that easy.

Emirates Business Class lounge has been re-opened with all the latest food and beverage offerings. There is a dedicated First Class area inside the Business Class lounge with table dining service and champagne bar. The timeless spa and shoe shine is also open now.

On my Emirates A380 flight to Cairo, all the usual service in First Class has returned to normal level. This include table dining service, first class shower and spa, A380 on-board lounge.

At the end of my flight, I felt extremely privileged to celebrate my birthday on-board. It has been a difficult year for everyone in aviation and especially on the A380 aircraft. COVID make us really appreciate things and not to take things for granted. I believe aviation will reach another peak when the challenge is over.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/esG-9UqftGY/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-21 14:43:26.087667,Right,0.0,['None'],Neutral,False,4,TOT58Rco3ok,2,Lil Wayne

Join me on this incredible flight from Leipzig to Bremen on the An-22. The plane picked up a special bus shipment in Bremen and we flew back to Leipzig. A total of 20 strong crew to operate the Antonov An-22 include 6 cockpit crew.

An-22 is not only the biggest turboprop aircraft in the world but it is the FIRST WIDE-BODY aircraft in the world! The plane is powered by four Kuznetsov NK-12 engines each driving a pair of contra-rotating propellers with unique sound.

An-22 holds a Guinness World record with max payload of 250 tons (551,156 lb) It is the only widebody freighter capable of operations at airports with unpaved runways or remote airstrip.

JN1q2NCNRPg,Sam Chui,UCfYCRj25JJQ41JGPqiqXmJw,1562983776.0,"The $20,000 Residence on Etihad A380","There's nothing like The Residence in commercial air travel. 

The Residence is above First Class; with a living room, separate bedroom and en-suite shower room, it is the only three-room suite on a commercial airline in the world. It is indeed the World's Premiere Flying Experience.

I hadn't flown The Residence in 2 years and I was very keen to re-live this fantastic experience, so I decided to dress up for the occasion. This flight was Etihad's inaugural A380 service from Abu Dhabi to Seoul Incheon.

On the return flight from Incheon to Abu Dhabi (next episode), I will be back in Economy to see the differences in travel experience on the same plane.

-------

Join me for my third, spectacular experience in Etihad Airway’s The Residence! The Residence is completely out of this world within the field of luxury, commercial passenger aviation, far surpassing any first class service that you might care to mention. It is unique in so many ways from providing the only, true double bed in a public, commercial aviation setting within your cabin to the provision of your own personal butler whilst in The Residence lounge and also whilst up in the air, trained in the prestigious Savoy Hotel in London.

I take the inaugural flight from Abu Dhabi international airport to Incheon Airport in Seoul, South Korea at the invitation of Etihad Airways, celebrating the launch of this new route in The Residence. I will be making the return journey in economy class in my next video guys, so watch out for that one!

If you’d like to see my first and second Residence experiences, you can see these in my videos here: 

https://youtu.be/1R2sOr6vZqo
https://youtu.be/Ss1XRl5dcMw

The Residence flying experience provides a home from home on the ground and then in the sky where any need or desire you could think of is expertly and carefully taken of. The Residence experience starts with being chauffeur driven in a luxury car (typically Audi, BMW or Mercedes) to the first class, VIP terminal of the airport where you are met by your personal luggage carrier, butler and chef.

Whilst waiting for your flight, you are housed in your own little palace with access to a spa (I opt to have an extremely relaxing and very nice and pleasant foot massage) and even a smoking room, lavishly decorated and stocked with the finest cigars, including Cuban, from around the world. Your own personal chef is on hand to deliver a Michelin Star level of dining experience, with each dish being hand crafted to your requirements and set in front of you with an explanation of each of the components of the dish before you begin eating. There are a wide variety of premium wines, spirits, beers and champagne to choose from.

Within your Residence lounge, there is a large, wall-mounted television and library. The Residence on the ground experience is absolutely sublime and a true masterpiece of comfort and service for the passenger.

At the gate to the aeroplane, I am met by the person who is to be my butler in the air. He introduces himself and up in the air, it’s clear that he cares – that’s what’s so great about Etihad Airway’s The Residence – the personal touch. They have researched my background before the day and present me with a number of aviation magazines to read and enjoy on the flight, as well as a framed photo of myself and a certificate to commemorate my travelling on this inaugural flight with Etihad in The Residence.

I am extremely impressed with the food I receive on the flight, with a delicious steak and chips being put before me as the main course and delicious little Asian sandwiches with succulent meat as a starter. I am also treated to Bellini Cipriani wine and a wonderful post-dinner digestif of Cellar 28 Remy Martin – greater opulence you couldn’t imagine, honestly!

After dinner, I can sprawl out on my double bed and watch TV in private, after taking a very relaxing and refreshing shower in my private bathroom on board. After sleeping, I rub my eyes to see my personal butler bringing a luxurious and mouth-watering breakfast of waffles and raspberries, served with champagne to get me in the mood to face a new day before we land.

Overall, I am once again bowled over by Etihad’s provision for me within The Residence class on board and I hold Etihad Airway’s The Residence in the highest regard. Would did you think of the whole fantastic experience? Let me know in the comments – as always, I am very pleased to share these gems of an aviation experience with you, my audience, and I thank you for watching.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JN1q2NCNRPg/hqdefault.jpg,2020-12-21 14:43:26.087842,Right,0.0,['None'],Neutral,False,4,TOT58Rco3ok,2,Lil Wayne

Here we are, just a year after the first news of the coronavirus we now call SARS-CoV-2 and the global pandemic known as COVID-19… and scientists have already developed more than one safe & effective vaccine. How did they do that so quickly? I visited the lab whose work directly led to these first COVID vaccines, so you can learn how basic research connects to life-saving medicine. This is how to make a COVID-19 vaccine.

lbPj-EYmw9Y,CNBC Television,UCrp_UI8XtuYfpiqluWLD7Lw,1608368023.0,FDA approves Moderna Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use,"CNBC's Meg Tirrell reports the FDA has now approved the Moderna vaccine for emergency use. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi 

The staff of the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday endorsed the emergency use of Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine, a critical step forward in winning formal clearance to be administered to the public as early as next week.

The staff report is meant to brief the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, which meets Thursday to review Moderna’s request for emergency use authorization.

The group of outside medical advisors recommended Pfizer’s vaccine for emergency use last Thursday, and the FDA approved it the next day. The committee is expected to recommend Moderna’s vaccine. The FDA doesn’t have to follow the committee’s recommendation, but it often does.

The FDA staff said it determined that the clinical trial results and safety data were “consistent with the recommendations set forth in FDA’s Guidance on Emergency Use Authorization for Vaccines to Prevent COVID-19.”

“FDA has determined that the Sponsor has provided adequate information to ensure the vaccine’s quality and consistency for authorization of the product under an EUA,” it said.

The announcement helped Moderna’s stock rise 1.5% just before the opening bell.

The documents are “enormously encouraging,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a voting member on the committee, adding they show there are now two highly effective vaccines. He voted in favor of recommending Pfizer’s vaccine last week.

Moderna is asking the FDA to approve the use in people age 18 and over, while Pfizer’s vaccine was cleared for use in people age 16 and older. The scant data in younger teens was a sticking point for the few members of the advisory committee who voted against authorizing Pfizer’s vaccine last week.

The FDA said it recommends tracking cases of Bell’s palsy, a condition that causes a sudden freezing or weakness in facial muscles, if the vaccine is cleared for use. The agency said there were three cases in the vaccine group and one in the placebo group among the 30,000 trial participants. “Currently available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine,” the agency wrote.

Offit agreed that the condition is worth monitoring as the vaccine rolls out. “I’m not dismissing that yet,” he said in an interview with CNBC.

When Merck submitted its data from its rotavirus vaccine trial, there were five cases of Kawasaki disease but none in the placebo group. That was “statistically significant” and caused Merck to change its label to note the cases.

The most common side effects were pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle pain and chills, the FDA said, adding more severe reactions were more common after the second dose. Trial participants told CNBC in September the symptoms were uncomfortable, and at times intense, the participants said they often went away after a day, sometimes sooner, and that it was better than getting Covid-19.

The FDA said 13 deaths were reported as of Dec. 3, with six in the vaccine group. Two deaths in the vaccine group were people over age 75 with preexisting conditions, the agency said. One case was a 72-year-old vaccine recipient with Crohn’s disease and short bowel syndrome who was hospitalized for thrombocytopenia and acute kidney failure.

Moderna submitted its Covid vaccine data to the FDA on Nov. 30. It said a final analysis of its phase three clinical trial found the vaccine was more than 94% effective in preventing Covid, was safe and appeared to fend off severe disease. Its vaccine uses messenger RNA, or mRNA, technology. It’s a new approach to vaccines that uses genetic material to provoke an immune response.

You can sense the movement of God’s Spirit. And unwanted spirits too!
Becca Greenwood believes the most overlooked key to your relationship with God is discerning what spiritual forces are at work around you. When you can both sense the movement of God’s Spirit and identify unwanted activity, you can speak out with power!

Becca says the gift of discernment is easily cultivated. Her 2-CD/audio series, Discernment Made Easy, can make a difference from Day One.

• How strongholds get established • The powerful role of forgiveness • How to repent and renounce • How to break soul ties and shake off traumas • How to recognize areas of strongholds then get free

You can sense the movement of God’s Spirit. And unwanted spirits too!
Becca Greenwood believes the most overlooked key to your relationship with God is discerning what spiritual forces are at work around you. When you can both sense the movement of God’s Spirit and identify unwanted activity, you can speak out with power!

In Discerning the Spirit Realm, Becca Greenwood offers her latest keys for standing your ground and engaging the unseen realm. Rebecca helps you…

• Recognize when unfriendly forces are at work—and shut them down.
• Walk in greater discernment without adopting a critical spirit
• Recognize essential cues from the natural realm

Becca says the gift of discernment is easily cultivated. Her 2-CD/audio series, Discernment Made Easy, can make a difference from Day One.

She also helps you shake off all-too-common hindrances—unwanted thoughts, desires and emotions that can cloud your spiritual life. Rebecca’s 64-page reference guide, Breaking Strongholds, gets right to the point and gives you these essential insights—

• How strongholds get established • The powerful role of forgiveness • How to repent and renounce • How to break soul ties and shake off traumas • How to recognize areas of strongholds then get free
