""Senator David Perdue of Georgia withdrew on Thursday from the final debate in his tight re-election race, a day after his Democratic challenger, Jon Ossoff, called him a “crook” and accused the vulnerable Republican of trying to profit from the coronavirus pandemic.

The rivals had been scheduled to face off on Sunday on the Atlanta television station WSB, the third debate in one of two pivotal Senate races in Georgia that could determine which party controls the chamber. The candidates had committed to the debate in September, according to Mr. Ossoff’s campaign.

The news first broke Thursday evening when Mr. Ossoff wrote on Twitter that Mr. Perdue had canceled on him.

“At last night’s debate, millions saw that Perdue had no answers when I called him out on his record of blatant corruption, widespread disease, and economic devastation,” Mr. Ossoff wrote. “Shame on you, Senator.”""

ajavsMbCapY,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,1604127786.0,"The Electoral College, explained","Why some Americans’ votes count more than others.

Watch more of our election coverage: http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

In the 2000 US presidential election, the Democratic candidate got half a million more votes than the Republican. The Democrat lost. Sixteen years later the same thing happened again. In the US, if you run for president, it does not actually matter how many people in the country vote for you. What matters instead is an arcane system for selecting America’s head of state called the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is the reason the US has something called “swing states,” and it’s the reason those places get to decide the future of the country. It’s the reason presidential candidates almost never campaign in the country’s biggest cities. And more recently, it’s also the reason that Republican candidates have been able to eke out victories in the presidential election without actually getting the most votes.

The Electoral College makes some Americans’ votes more powerful than others. In fact, that’s part of the reason we have it to begin with; in the country’s early years, the Electoral College helped give the votes of Southern Whites more weight than the votes of Northerners. The idea at its core, that certain votes simply matter more than others, is baked into the American tradition. In the 2020 election, it may decide the winner.

Further reading:
The historian Alexander Keyssar’s book “Why Do We Still Have the Electoral College?” takes you through the history and function of the Electoral College: https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674660151

For the bite-sized version of that history, Keyssar also wrote this piece in the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/opinion/electoral-college-racism-white-supremacy.html

The Times also had a great interactive feature on where the 2020 candidates actually spent money: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/17/us/politics/trump-biden-campaign-ad-spending.html

Pew has a breakdown of how democracies around the world elect their head of state, which really shows what an oddball the US is: https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/22/among-democracies-u-s-stands-out-in-how-it-chooses-its-head-of-state/

Four years on, he's presiding over a nation that is bitterly divided with a troubled economy and a population ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic.

With just over a week to go before polling day, Four Corners examines whether Donald Trump can once again defy the polls and his critics and secure a second presidential term.

Opinion polls are giving Democrat contender Joe Biden a decisive lead, and despite Donald Trump's insistence, even some of his most prominent supporters concede he has a battle on his hands.

He's walked out of important treaties. He's lashed out against America's friends. He has cozied up to authoritarians. He's abandoned the most important international treaties of our time. And he has even threatened NATO — the bedrock of America's global power. It's diplomatic disruption on an unprecedented scale. But even for America's shell-shocked allies, it may not be all bad. So just how much has Trump disrupted transatlantic relations? DW's Chief International Editor Richard Walker explains why Europe is praying for a Joe Biden win in the 2020 US election.

Watch more of our election coverage: http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

In the 2000 US presidential election, the Democratic candidate got half a million more votes than the Republican. The Democrat lost. Sixteen years later the same thing happened again. In the US, if you run for president, it does not actually matter how many people in the country vote for you. What matters instead is an arcane system for selecting America’s head of state called the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is the reason the US has something called “swing states,” and it’s the reason those places get to decide the future of the country. It’s the reason presidential candidates almost never campaign in the country’s biggest cities. And more recently, it’s also the reason that Republican candidates have been able to eke out victories in the presidential election without actually getting the most votes.

The Electoral College makes some Americans’ votes more powerful than others. In fact, that’s part of the reason we have it to begin with; in the country’s early years, the Electoral College helped give the votes of Southern Whites more weight than the votes of Northerners. The idea at its core, that certain votes simply matter more than others, is baked into the American tradition. In the 2020 election, it may decide the winner.

Further reading:
The historian Alexander Keyssar’s book “Why Do We Still Have the Electoral College?” takes you through the history and function of the Electoral College: https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674660151

For the bite-sized version of that history, Keyssar also wrote this piece in the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/opinion/electoral-college-racism-white-supremacy.html

The Times also had a great interactive feature on where the 2020 candidates actually spent money: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/17/us/politics/trump-biden-campaign-ad-spending.html

Pew has a breakdown of how democracies around the world elect their head of state, which really shows what an oddball the US is: https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/22/among-democracies-u-s-stands-out-in-how-it-chooses-its-head-of-state/

Last two times there was around one percent difference in the popular vote between winners and losers. A key, perhaps the key voting bloc is formed by Latino Americans. They make up 20 percent of Floridian voters - and they're active voters. The Republicans and the president have tapped into a narrative that appeals. Carolina Chimoy went to meet Latinos for Trump. 

On the other hand the Trump administration's crackdown on migration from Latin America leaves undocumented immigrants at the mercy of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. A human rights group in Georgia asks voters to help bring about immigration reform.

If the 2020 US presidential election is close, the race could drag on in the courts and halls of Congress long after ballots are cast, says lawyer and political commentator Van Jones. Explaining why the customary concession speech is one of the most important safeguards for democracy, Jones exposes shocking legal loopholes that could enable a candidate to grab power even if they lose both the popular vote and the electoral college -- and shares what ordinary citizens can do if there's no peaceful transfer of power.

Prop 22 would, if passed, exempt rideshare companies such as Uber and Lyft and delivery companies such as Doordash from being required to hire their drivers and no longer use them as independent contractors. It is the result of  AB5 passed and signed by the governor which eliminated independent contract work with notable exceptions. NBC4’s Conan Nolan  talks with both sides. Doug Mead,  an Uber driver, represents the “Yes on Prop. 22”.  Alma Hernandez, Executive Director of the Service Employee International Union (SEIU), represents the No on Proposition 22.

Reason is the planet's leading source of news, politics, and culture from a libertarian perspective. Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.
---------

Leftists began to hate Peterson after he said he'd disobey a proposed Canadian law that would force Canadians to call anyone who doesn't want to be called ""he or she"" something else, like ""ze"" or ""xe.""

When Peterson said he'd refuse to obey, angry students shouted Peterson down, blowing air horns and screaming to make sure others couldn't hear.

Peterson defends his position to John Stossel: ""I don't care what people want to be called. That's fine, but that doesn't mean I should be compelled by law to call them that.""

It's not just students who slam Peterson. In one TV interview, Peterson stayed calm while the host tried to put words in his mouth.

""You are saying that women aren't intelligent enough to run these top companies....You don't believe in equal pay,"" Cathy Newman, the reporter at Britain's Channel 4 News, insisted.

""No, I'm not saying that at all,"" Peterson responded. He hadn't said that. What he had said, is that natural differences explain most of the gender wage gap.

As an example, Peterson cites studies that find, in wealthy countries that focus most on equality, like Sweden, even fewer women major in science and math. Instead they pick fields that deal with people, like teaching, and men tend more toward technical fields.

Peterson says this shows that when men and women have the most freedom to decide what they do, they pick fields that line up with their natural biological interests.

That idea infuriates leftists. ""It should infuriate them,"" Peterson tells Stossel. ""Because I'm going right at the heart of the radical leftist doctrine.""

That doctrine is social justice, the idea that all groups should have equal outcomes; that there should be just as many female CEOs, scientists, and computer programmers, because men and women are essentially the same. If outcomes differ, it must be sexism.

Peterson says that the focus on group equality is a spinoff of Marxism. That after Marxism failed spectacularly in the economic realm, Marxists applied their way of thinking to issues like the difference between men and women.

""We've got a hundred million corpses stacked up to demonstrate"" the failure of Marxism, says Peterson. And the new Marxism-derived focus on group equality won't end any better.

Peterson calls for the opposite of Marxism–a focus on the individual.

He says people should stick with ""the principles that govern the West; capitalist principles. The free market principles."" With those principles ""we do better than any place has ever done.""

Q&A is a television discussion program that focuses mostly on politics but ranges across all of the big issues that set Australians thinking, talking and debating.

It is driven by interaction: Q&A provides a rare opportunity for Australian citizens to directly question and hold to account politicians and key opinion leaders in a national public forum and Q&A is broadcast live so that not only the studio audience but also the wider audience can get involved.

We aim to create a discussion that is constructive, that reflects a diverse range of views and that provides a safe environment where people can respectfully discuss their differences.

It’s impossible to represent every view on a single panel or in one audience but we’re committed to giving participants a fair go.

In order to be as inclusive and diverse as possible, the program is presented from a range of locations around the country and all Australians are encouraged to get involved through social media as well as by joining the audience.

He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.

Sowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master’s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.

Sowell’s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).

Robinson and Sowell discuss Sowell’s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.

Democratic socialists in the United States point to Sweden as a socialist success. But Swedish historian Johan Norberg says, ""Sweden is not socialist.""

Norberg hosts a documentary called Sweden: Lessons for America?, in which he notes that in Sweden, ""government doesn't own the means of production. To see that you have to go to Venezuela or Cuba or North Korea.""

John Stossel asks Norberg why so many Americans think Sweden is socialist. Norberg answers, ""We did have a period in the 1970s and 1980s when we had something that resembled socialism: a big government that taxed and spent heavily.""

But big government led to problems. ""Our economy was in crisis, inflation reached 10 percent, and for a brief period interest rates soared to 500 percent. At that point the Swedish population just said, 'Enough, we can't do this,'"" Norberg says.

Sweden cut public spending, privatized the national rail network, abolished certain government monopolies, eliminated inheritance taxes, sold state-owned businesses, and switched to a school voucher system. It also ""lowered taxes and reformed the pension system,"" adds Norberg.

So Stossel asks why we keep hearing ""that Sweden is this socialist paradise.""

Norberg answers: ""We do have a bigger welfare state than the U.S. and higher taxes than the U.S. But in other areas, when it comes to free markets, when it comes to competition, when it comes to free trade, Sweden is actually more free market.""

He's right, according to the Heritage Foundation's Economic Freedom Rankings. Sweden ranks higher than the U.S.

Norberg also tells Stossel that Sweden's tax system may surprise Americans. ""This is the dirty little secret....We don't take from the rich and give to the poor. We squeeze the poor, because rich people might leave.""

Even people who earn below average income pay up to 60 percent in taxes.

Stossel asks: What lessons should Americans take from Sweden?

""You can't turn your backs [on] the creation of wealth,"" warns Norberg.

Sweden: Lessons for America? airs on PBS on October 29th at 7 p.m. Eastern. You can also watch it at freetochoose.tv.

Minneapolis burned even though it adopted most every ""progressive"" idea: a $15 minimum wage, housing subsidies, mandatory paid leave, ""green"" targets, strong unions, and the most expensive school system in the state.

Did they at least reduce the racial income gap?  Minneapolis’ black/white income disparity is about the biggest in the country.

That confuses the media. “Minneapolis had progressive policies, but its economy still left black families behind,” reads a headline in the Washington Post. 

Instead of “but,"" the word should be: “therefore.” 

Because as Minnesota Senate candidate Jason Lewis points out: ""When you take away the incentive for work and savings and investment, you get less of it.""

But Minneapolis politicians say they just need even more government.  And even less free enterprise!

John Stossel asks: What could make a book about responsibility take off?

""People have been fed this diet of pabulum, rights, and impulsive freedom,"" Peterson tells Stossel. ""There's just an absolute starvation for the other side of the story.""

The other side of the story, according to Peterson, is that ""it's in responsibility that most people find the meaning that sustains them through life. It's not in happiness. It's not in impulsive pleasure.""

Peterson instead advises: ""Adopt responsibility for your own well-being, try to put your family together, try to serve your community, try to seek for eternal truth....That's the sort of thing that can ground you in your life, enough so that you can withstand the difficulty of life.""

Many leftists hate Peterson. They attack him for saying people should be ""dangerous."" Peterson explains to Stossel that he means people should have the capacity to be dangerous, but control it.

""People who teach martial arts know this full well,"" Peterson says. ""If you learn a martial art you learn to be dangerous, but simultaneously you learn to control it.""

Advice about that, and responsibility, bring Peterson big audiences.

Have you seen the Jordan Peterson and Cathy Newman debate?
See for yourself how he deals with it and give us your opinion in the comments! 

We've all found ourselves in conversation and felt attacked like we started off talking about one thing and then the other person twisted our words and before we knew it, we lost our cool, lost respect in their eyes, and maybe even acted like a jerk. Now, I don't normally do the same person twice in a row but this interview between Cathy Newman and Jordan Peterson was just too interesting of an opportunity to discuss how you can handle someone who uses subtle conversational tricks to bully you into looking dumb. So in this video, you're gonna see firsthand some of the most common tricks that people might be using on you and you're also gonna learn how to reverse those so that you can walk out of a kind of aggressive situation having earned more respect than you had going in. 

So first off, to stop a conversational bully, you have to realize what's going on before it's too late. Now, typically, a person will reveal their aggressive attitude early on with their tone of voice and their word choice. Check out the rest that we will show in this video and how Jordan Peterson tackles them.

Leftists began to hate Peterson after he said he'd disobey a proposed Canadian law that would force Canadians to call anyone who doesn't want to be called ""he or she"" something else, like ""ze"" or ""xe.""

When Peterson said he'd refuse to obey, angry students shouted Peterson down, blowing air horns and screaming to make sure others couldn't hear.

Peterson defends his position to John Stossel: ""I don't care what people want to be called. That's fine, but that doesn't mean I should be compelled by law to call them that.""

It's not just students who slam Peterson. In one TV interview, Peterson stayed calm while the host tried to put words in his mouth.

""You are saying that women aren't intelligent enough to run these top companies....You don't believe in equal pay,"" Cathy Newman, the reporter at Britain's Channel 4 News, insisted.

""No, I'm not saying that at all,"" Peterson responded. He hadn't said that. What he had said, is that natural differences explain most of the gender wage gap.

As an example, Peterson cites studies that find, in wealthy countries that focus most on equality, like Sweden, even fewer women major in science and math. Instead they pick fields that deal with people, like teaching, and men tend more toward technical fields.

Peterson says this shows that when men and women have the most freedom to decide what they do, they pick fields that line up with their natural biological interests.

That idea infuriates leftists. ""It should infuriate them,"" Peterson tells Stossel. ""Because I'm going right at the heart of the radical leftist doctrine.""

That doctrine is social justice, the idea that all groups should have equal outcomes; that there should be just as many female CEOs, scientists, and computer programmers, because men and women are essentially the same. If outcomes differ, it must be sexism.

Peterson says that the focus on group equality is a spinoff of Marxism. That after Marxism failed spectacularly in the economic realm, Marxists applied their way of thinking to issues like the difference between men and women.

""We've got a hundred million corpses stacked up to demonstrate"" the failure of Marxism, says Peterson. And the new Marxism-derived focus on group equality won't end any better.

Peterson calls for the opposite of Marxism–a focus on the individual.

He says people should stick with ""the principles that govern the West; capitalist principles. The free market principles."" With those principles ""we do better than any place has ever done.""

More than half of the world's poorest people live in sub-Saharan Africa.

Why is that region so poor? There are lots of theories. Some blame a colonial history. Others blame the weather, or discrimination.

Magatte Wade, an African entrepreneur, tells John Stossel that she knows the biggest reason from her own first-hand experience: It's crushing government regulation.

""Once you hire someone, good luck getting rid of them for any reason,"" she says. Her home country, Senegal, requires government permission to fire an employee. That makes it hard to run a business. It also makes entrepreneurs reluctant to hire.

Then there's the complicated tax code.

""Some people say it's worth at least two or three truckloads of paper,"" she says. Hiring an accountant to wade through that is expensive for new businesses.

Magatte started a business anyway—she makes lip balm. She has to import several ingredients that are not made in Senegal.

""Some of them have a 70 percent import tariff on them!"" Wade complains.

High taxes and complex rules often lead to corruption, because people pay bribes to get around the rules. Wade says corruption ""a natural consequence of stupid senseless idiot laws….The only way to fix corruption is to simplify.""

Wade's business survives without corruption, she says. One reason is that she was fortunate to find a bureaucrat who helped her find a way around the ruinous tariffs.

""We found a clause in one of the binders saying actually if you're exporting at least 80 percent of your products and if you've been in business for two years then you can ask for an exemption,"" she said.

Well-meaning Westerners often try to help Africa with aid. Tom's Shoes gives a pair of shoes to someone in the developing world for every pair customers buy. But Wade points out that such donations destroy local African shoemakers.

Instead of aid, she says, demand that rules be cut. That would create jobs.

""If I have a job then, guess what?"" Wade asks. ""My malnutrition problem goes poof! My uneven access to clean water goes poof. It's just poof, poof, poof!

""Create greater economic freedom…in all countries,"" Wade concludes. ""So that all people everywhere get a chance to experience free enterprise.""

He points out that even as fires raged behind reporters during recent protests, the media still call the protests “mostly peaceful.”

""Experts"" at Imperial College London told us: shut things down for COVID-19, or more than 2 million Americans will die! 

They also said, even if the whole population socially-distanced, more than 1 million will die by August.

The “experts” model was way off. So far, almost 140,000 Americans have died. 

Yet that same flawed model convinced the United Kingdom to implement a costly lock down. President Donald Trump cited it, too.

Too often, such rhetoric is used to shut down dissent.

  At the New York Times, head opinion editor James Bennett resigned for committing the sin of running an op-ed by a Republican senator, which said the military should help control riots.

Bennett resigned after his colleagues took to Twitter and eerily all posted this exact same wording: ""Running this puts Black @NYTimes staffers in danger.""

""That language spoke to a potential legal concern,” says Robby Soave, author of ""Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump"". 

""Various workplace harassment protections that are well-intended,” says Soave, lead activists to say, ""if you have a responsibility to have a racially hospitable climate in the workplace, then how can you allow someone to say something that offends me?'""

I point out: ""But [Cotton's op-ed] didn't put their lives in danger.""

""No it didn't,"" he responds. ""It's absurd, and they're only claiming it because that's their way -- that's their tactic for seizing power in the workplace.""

Soave also says he knows where they learned this tactic, on college campuses.

He covered the incident in 2016 where dozens of Yale students surrounded a professor and shouted at him, calling for him to be fired.

What had he done? He defended his wife for sending out an email to students saying she had no business censoring Halloween costumes -- even ones that represented people from other cultures. 

""The message that you sent proclaiming that cultural appropriation on Halloween is totally permissible is, is hurtful!” shouted one student.

Others broke into tears. One refused to shake the professor's hand, shouting, ""I want your job to be taken from you!""

It was. He had to resign as the head of a Yale residential house. His wife did, too, and she also quit teaching.

Now those former students have graduated, and many are using the same tactics in the workforce, especially in the news media.

The Green New Deal calls for a transition to 100 percent renewable energy, many more wind turbines and solar panels.

But the wind doesn’t always blow and the sun doesn’t always shine.

Because of that, Meigs explains, “You also have to build all this infrastructure to connect [renewables] with energy consumers possibly very far away, and you always need some kind of backup power.”

That means many more transmission lines and bigger batteries.

But “batteries are lousy way to store energy” says physicist Mark Mills, a Senior Fellow at the Manhattan Institute. He also points out that wind mills and solar panels are anything but green, “I have to dig up a 1,000 pounds of stuff to process it … digging up is done with oil, by the way, big machines, so we're consuming energy to quote, save energy. It's not a good path to go.”

It would also be very expensive.

Mills points out, ""We're charging more for people who can't afford it and we give money to wealthy people in the form of subsidies to buy 100,000 dollar [electric] cars, put expensive solar arrays on their roof or to be investors in wind farms. We have an upside down Robin Hood in our country to the tunes of 10s and 100s of billions of dollars.""

The bottom line, the Green New Deal, even if it were scientifically possible:

Would hurt the poor.

Cost everyone more.

America probably can't afford it. Our federal debt is now where Greece’s debt was just before it’s peak financial crisis. Unemployment there hit 27%. 

Greece got bailed out, but nobody will bail America out. 

So how will America pay off its debt? 

There are really three options:

-- Default 
-- Print money
-- Raise taxes

All are awful choices.

20 years ago, Bill Clinton said that China wouldn't be able to censor the internet. ""That’s sort of like trying to nail jello to the wall,"" Clinton quipped, to laughter.

""Well, the Chinese figured out how to nail jello to the wall,"" journalist Melissa Chen of The Spectator explains. ""They built an almost perfectly walled-in internet. What they call the Great Firewall.""

The world wide web is not world wide in China. Most major Western internet sites are blocked. 

A few computer nerds evade the ban, but by and large, China effectively controls their internet. Even harmless jokes are banned. 

Because China's dictator, Xi Jinping, looks a bit like Winnie the Pooh, now ""any time a Winnie the Pooh picture or somebody mentioning Winnie the Pooh ends up getting scrubbed from the internet,"" Chen explains.

People who post forbidden things online may have their lives restricted.

""You can't make doctor's appointments... you can't travel. So they'll block you from buying a train ticket or a plane ticket. You can't basically engage in modern day life in China.""

China's minorities have it even worse. The government wages cultural genocide against the Uighurs population. 

It's cracked down on Hong Kong, too, where protesters demanding freedom waved American flags. They understand the importance of freedom.

b9pgh5EO6lw,John Stossel,UCjo1uN-aM3rmBV46xj7l2KA,1548809230.0,Bad Laws Cause Homeless Crisis,"Parts of San Francisco resemble the poorest slums in the world -- even though the city is one of the richest in America.

---------

Encampments of street people are everywhere. Some pitch tents. Others defecate on the sidewalk. Some are mentally ill and harass people.

John Stossel asks: ""why does such a rich city have a huge problem with homelessness?""

One reason in that the city fails to enforce even basic laws against bad behavior.

The Daily Wire's Colton Haas filmed one woman who says: ""Police don't do anything about it. They'll get somebody for drinking a beer but they'll walk right past people using a needle.""

Many crimes, from shoplifting to car break-ins, are often ignored in San Francisco. An average of 85 cars are broken into every day in the city. Yet police make arrests in less than 2 percent of car break-ins.

Even some street people complain about the behavior of crazy and violent homeless people. ""They run around and they shout at themselves ... They make it bad for people like us that hang out with a sign,"" one man who usually sleeps on the street told us.

Since store owners can't rely on city cops to deal with the masses of homeless, some hire private police to patrol around their stores. Private police are effective, and there used to be hundreds. But then the city's police union complained, and now there are fewer than 10 left.

Stossel notes that another reason for the city's homeless problem is that the city offers relatively generous benefits: free shelter, train tickets, and $70/month in cash. That's in addition to food stamps people can already get.

San Francisco's politicians have promised to fix the homeless problem for decades.

In 1982, then-mayor Dianne Feinstein bragged about creating ""A thousands units right here in the Tenderloin"" for the homeless.
In 2002, mayor Willie Brown said ""you gotta do something about it.""
In 2008, mayor Gavin Newsom said, ""our combined efforts ... have already moved 6,860 human beings off the street.""
In 2018, San Francisco's mayor was still calling for more money. San Francisco also passed a big new tax on employers to raise money.

But so far, the extra funding hasn't worked. The number of street people has grown most every year.

One reason is that rents in San Francisco are the highest in the nation.

Laura Foote is an activist who runs the non-profit ""YIMBY"" -- or ""Yes In My Backyard."" She tries to convince people to allow more housing. But even in liberal San Francisco, many people don't want that.

""I would hate it. I would hate it,"" one woman told John Stossel.

""I think it'd be really congested,"" said another.

Developers complain the city severely limits them.

""Let me build,"" says developer John Dennis. He spent years trying to get permission to replace a graffiti-covered, long-defunct meat-packing plant with nice new apartments.

He eventually got permission to develop the new building will house 60 people, but it took 4 years.

""And all that time, we're paying property taxes and we're paying for maintenance of the building,"" Dennis tells Stossel.

""What's your next project in San Francisco?"" Stossel asks.

""No more projects in San Francisco,"" Dennis replies. ""I'm done. I'll never do another project here.""

Stossel points out the hypocrisy of the situation: ""People in San Francisco often claim to be all about helping the poor. But their policies make life tougher for the poor.""",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b9pgh5EO6lw/hqdefault.jpg,2020-11-02 20:58:52.250577,Right,2.75,"['Libertarian', 'PartisanRight', 'AntiSJW', 'Libertarian', 'AntiSJW', 'Libertarian', 'Libertarian', 'PartisanRight']",Far Right,False,3,c1b6VtaIqwA,3,Jo Jorgensen

Minneapolis burned even though it adopted most every ""progressive"" idea: a $15 minimum wage, housing subsidies, mandatory paid leave, ""green"" targets, strong unions, and the most expensive school system in the state.

Did they at least reduce the racial income gap?  Minneapolis’ black/white income disparity is about the biggest in the country.

That confuses the media. “Minneapolis had progressive policies, but its economy still left black families behind,” reads a headline in the Washington Post. 

Instead of “but,"" the word should be: “therefore.” 

Because as Minnesota Senate candidate Jason Lewis points out: ""When you take away the incentive for work and savings and investment, you get less of it.""

Leftists began to hate Peterson after he said he'd disobey a proposed Canadian law that would force Canadians to call anyone who doesn't want to be called ""he or she"" something else, like ""ze"" or ""xe.""

When Peterson said he'd refuse to obey, angry students shouted Peterson down, blowing air horns and screaming to make sure others couldn't hear.

Peterson defends his position to John Stossel: ""I don't care what people want to be called. That's fine, but that doesn't mean I should be compelled by law to call them that.""

It's not just students who slam Peterson. In one TV interview, Peterson stayed calm while the host tried to put words in his mouth.

""You are saying that women aren't intelligent enough to run these top companies....You don't believe in equal pay,"" Cathy Newman, the reporter at Britain's Channel 4 News, insisted.

""No, I'm not saying that at all,"" Peterson responded. He hadn't said that. What he had said, is that natural differences explain most of the gender wage gap.

As an example, Peterson cites studies that find, in wealthy countries that focus most on equality, like Sweden, even fewer women major in science and math. Instead they pick fields that deal with people, like teaching, and men tend more toward technical fields.

Peterson says this shows that when men and women have the most freedom to decide what they do, they pick fields that line up with their natural biological interests.

That idea infuriates leftists. ""It should infuriate them,"" Peterson tells Stossel. ""Because I'm going right at the heart of the radical leftist doctrine.""

That doctrine is social justice, the idea that all groups should have equal outcomes; that there should be just as many female CEOs, scientists, and computer programmers, because men and women are essentially the same. If outcomes differ, it must be sexism.

Peterson says that the focus on group equality is a spinoff of Marxism. That after Marxism failed spectacularly in the economic realm, Marxists applied their way of thinking to issues like the difference between men and women.

""We've got a hundred million corpses stacked up to demonstrate"" the failure of Marxism, says Peterson. And the new Marxism-derived focus on group equality won't end any better.

Peterson calls for the opposite of Marxism–a focus on the individual.

He says people should stick with ""the principles that govern the West; capitalist principles. The free market principles."" With those principles ""we do better than any place has ever done.""

""Experts"" at Imperial College London told us: shut things down for COVID-19, or more than 2 million Americans will die! 

They also said, even if the whole population socially-distanced, more than 1 million will die by August.

The “experts” model was way off. So far, almost 140,000 Americans have died. 

Yet that same flawed model convinced the United Kingdom to implement a costly lock down. President Donald Trump cited it, too.

Too often, such rhetoric is used to shut down dissent.

""There is no such thing as 'THE science',"" science journalist Matt Ridley tells me. ""There is science. And science consists of people disagreeing with each other.""

In the case of that failed COVID-19 model, we all should have been wary. The same researchers had an awful track record, having predicted 136,000 deaths from mad cow disease, 65,000 from swine flu, and 200 million from bird flu. The actual number of deaths, for each of those diseases, was in the hundreds!

--------- 
Will Smith warns of “a systematic bias that needs to be addressed.”

John Stossel says "" they never talk about: diversity of thought.”

Hollywood movies are full of anti-capitalist themes.

In Avatar, GREEDY miners will destroy a planet for valuable ore.

In Amazon’s new Jack Ryan, Socialism is not to blame for Venezuela’s problems. Venezuela’s dictator is an anti-leftist nationalist. The “good” Venezuelan politician is a “social justice” advocate.  

Stossel points out that “Hollywood’s documentaries also celebrate the left.”

RBG, for example, puts Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg on a pedestal.

“Justice Ginsberg is impressive. But so is Justice Thomas. Would Hollywood ever praise him?” asks Stossel.

Hollywood’s condescension toward anyone not on the left frustrates the few actors who lean right. Most fear saying anything because they’d lose work. But actor Kevin Sorbo talks about it.

“All of a sudden … less and less calls. My agent said we'd better part ways and I went, ‘wow, I made a lot of money for these guys,” recalls Sorbo. 

“Did you ask him, why do we have to part ways?” asks Stossel.

“I knew why. They told me why. They were pretty straight forward about it,” responds Sorbo.  

Kevin Sorbo was even banned from a comic-book convention, East Coast Comicon.

He says, “[Hollywood has] the most anti-tolerant people and hateful people that we have right now.”
 
Sorbo continues, “Every movie I’ve seen now, every TV show I seem to see, doesn't matter what it is, there's always some point, someplace, where they'll … degrade anybody who's conservative or Republican.”

His response was to produce his own films,  like God’s Not Dead, a Christian film that cost two million dollars but returned 140 million.

--------

--------- 
Even as Venezuelans starve, Senator Rand Paul notes that socialism has gained ground in the United States.

That's why he wrote ""The Case Against Socialism."" The chapter on Venezuelan socialism is titled, ""Because Eating Your Pets is Overrated.”

""You would think that ... when your economy gets to the point where people are eating their pets, people might have second thoughts about what economic system they’ve chosen,” Senator Paul tells John Stossel.

But Stossel notes that today American socialists say: ""We won’t be like that.”  Senator Bernie Sanders says, “when I talk about democratic socialism, I’m not looking at Venezuela. I’m not looking at Cuba. I’m looking at countries like Denmark and Sweden.”

But Paul debunks that myth in his book. 

""It's not true that the Scandinavian countries are socialist,"" Paul tells Stossel. 

Stossel points out that while Scandinavia tried socialist policies years ago, they then turned away from socialism, privatizing industries and repealing regulations. In fact, when experts rank economic freedom, Scandinavian countries rank near the top.

Denmark's prime minister even responded to Sanders, saying: ""Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy.""

Scandinavia did keep socialist policies like government-run health care. Media outlets suggest that's why Scandinavians live longer. 

But Paul says: ""This is the trick of statistics ... it started way before socialized medicine.""

His book has the stats to back that up. In the 1960s, before Sweden's healthcare was totally nationalized, Swedish men already lived 5 years longer than American men. Now, they... still live 5 years longer. 

Stossel says Paul’s book is different from other politicians’ platitude-filled books.  Paul did actual research. He cites sources that back up his point about health care:

-- Swedish men in 1960s:  https://www.scb.se/en/finding-statistics/statistics-by-subject-area/population/population-composition/population-statistics/pong/tables-and-graphs/yearly-statistics--the-whole-country/life-expectancy/
-- American men in 1960s:  https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/hus15.pdf#015

Regarding Sweden's ability to pull people out of poverty, Paul credits Swedish culture, not government programs.  He tells Stossel of a story about Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman:

""This Swedish economist comes up to him and he says, 'You know in Sweden we have no poverty.' And Friedman responds, 'Well, yeah, in America we have no poverty among Swedish Americans.’"" 

Paul confirms that with data from Swedish researcher Nima Sanandaji, who writes: ""Danish Americans today have fully 55 percent higher living standard than Danes. Similarly, Swedish Americans have a 53 percent higher living standard than Swedes.""

Stossel says it's good that Senator Paul debunks these myths and warns against repeating the tragic history of socialism.

Paul gives a partial list of failures: ""Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, Castro, Chavez, Maduro. It doesn’t work.""",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3bdu9Apy1uo/hqdefault.jpg,2020-11-02 20:58:52.784170,Right,2.75,"['Libertarian', 'PartisanRight', 'AntiSJW', 'Libertarian', 'AntiSJW', 'Libertarian', 'Libertarian', 'PartisanRight']",Far Right,False,4,yN3WZUgYcV0,3,Jo Jorgensen

The Green New Deal calls for a transition to 100 percent renewable energy, many more wind turbines and solar panels.

But the wind doesn’t always blow and the sun doesn’t always shine.

Because of that, Meigs explains, “You also have to build all this infrastructure to connect [renewables] with energy consumers possibly very far away, and you always need some kind of backup power.”

That means many more transmission lines and bigger batteries.

But “batteries are lousy way to store energy” says physicist Mark Mills, a Senior Fellow at the Manhattan Institute. He also points out that wind mills and solar panels are anything but green, “I have to dig up a 1,000 pounds of stuff to process it … digging up is done with oil, by the way, big machines, so we're consuming energy to quote, save energy. It's not a good path to go.”

It would also be very expensive.

Mills points out, ""We're charging more for people who can't afford it and we give money to wealthy people in the form of subsidies to buy 100,000 dollar [electric] cars, put expensive solar arrays on their roof or to be investors in wind farms. We have an upside down Robin Hood in our country to the tunes of 10s and 100s of billions of dollars.""

Lately, we hear that men and women are biologically the same.

A BBC video claims, ""there seems to be no purely male brains versus female brains.""

""Seems like we’re just not that different after all,"" echoes the Huffington Post.

Politically correct corporations act as if that were true. When Google engineer James Damore merely suggested that biological differences might explain why half the people in tech are not women, he was fired.

Professor Gina Rippon recently wrote a book that confirms the popular narrative. ""New neuroscience that shatters the myth of the female brain"" is the subtitle.

Rippon tells Stossel it's important to tell people that that men’s and women’s brains are the same, so people don't mindlessly follow gender stereotypes.

Stossel pushes back,  ""It's not natural that in school, more boys want to play football and more girls want to do ballet?  I want to run and bang into people.""

Rippon responds: ""Well, I think actually girls might want to run and bang into people, but because there's an image that girls don't do that, they're stopped from doing that.""

That's popular to say, but Stossel has covered research that shows big innate differences. In one experiment, students were blindfolded and then walked through the maze of tunnels. They were then asked which direction they'd moved. Men had a much better sense of that than women.

In another experiment, students were left in a cluttered room to wait. Later, women were much better at remembering all kinds of details about that room. Men were more likely to say: ""I dunno, some stuff"".

Of course, the students may already have been molded by a sexist society, Stossel notes -- but newborns also show gender differences. Boys tend to look longer at objects, like tractor parts, while infant girls stared more at faces.

Stossel asks Rippon about that, who responds: ""if you look very closely at the data, a third of the girls actually seem to respond more to the tractor parts than the boys.""

""A third,"" Stossel repeats.

""A third,"" Rippon replies.

""But two-thirds didn't!"" Stossel retorts.

Rippon says the study should be redone. ""Do it again with a bigger set of newborns [and] a better controlled set of stimuli.”

Evolutionary psychologist Diana Fleischman says there's overwhelming evidence of biological differences. 

""Cultures around the world show very similar differences between men and women,"" she points out. ""Men are more likely to seek status, women are more likely to take care of children. Women are more likely to stay in the home. Men are more likely to do dangerous, aggressive things like go to war.""

Stossel pushes back: ""Because we men have been socialized: 'work's important!' And you women have been told by your mothers, 'take care of the kids.'""

""Why would you see that across every culture in the world?"" Fleischman responds.

""Even if you look at nonhuman animals … monkeys ... they don't have culture, yet there's still these very large differences between males and females,"" she adds. In those species, too, males focus on war and status, while females nurture children.

Among scientists, these differences are well-accepted, Stossel notes. The journal Neuroscience cited 70 studies that found differences.

Stossel asked Gina about some of the most obvious mental differences.

""I stutter. Most stutterers are boys. It's not a brain difference?""

""Yeah, yeah. There are those kinds of brain differences and I'm definitely not a brain difference denier,"" Rippon replied.

Rippon worries that talk of sex difference will increase sexism, but Fleischman notes that minimizing sex differences can hurt people, too, by pushing them into fields they're not naturally suited for.  Politicians pass laws to force ""equality"".

""Saying that men and women have different aptitudes isn't sexism. It's actually a statement about the true nature of the world,"" Fleischman says.  ""If we keep saying that those differences in what men and women choose to do are because of sexism, nobody's going to end up happy with what they're doing, and we're going to keep making laws to remedy what's actually just the result of freedom.""

Criminal law has exploded in size and scope. There are more than 300,000 federal criminal laws alone. 
 
“There's a federal prohibition on walking a dog on a leash longer than six feet on federal property. It is a jailable offense,” says Rafael Mangual of City Journal. “Anyone can be prosecuted for almost anything.”
 
Like trying to save animals during a hurricane. That got Tammy Hedges in trouble.
 
She was charged with 12 counts of “misdemeanor practicing or attempting veterinary medicine without a license.”
 
Her crime? Sheltering animals. Or as she put it: “mak[ing] sure that they were not out there drowning.”
 
According to the prosecutor, “a passion and love of animals is laudable but does not excuse unnecessarily putting their health at risk.”
 
“The idea that these people were engaged in the sort of behavior that ought to be met with jail time really does seem to belie reality,” Mangual tells Stossel.
 
“How did we get here, with so many laws even lawyers can’t count them?” asks Stossel.
 
“At the federal level, 98% of criminal laws are not passed by elected representatives. They are created entirely by unelected bureaucrats who don’t have to answer to anyone” Mangual responds. 

Many of the laws exist because politically connected people don’t like newcomers entering their turf.  “At the root of a lot of the overcriminalization problem is … established players who want to use the government to keep them protected from competition” explains Mangual.
 
This overcriminalization puts everyone at risk of being prosecuted for things that we don’t even know are illegal,” says Stossel.
 
Mangual agrees: “It's impossible to know what sort of behavior is criminal. When they get labeled as criminals, that stays with them through their whole life.”",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2zQrSNlLzQM/hqdefault.jpg,2020-11-02 20:58:52.784311,Right,2.75,"['Libertarian', 'PartisanRight', 'AntiSJW', 'Libertarian', 'AntiSJW', 'Libertarian', 'Libertarian', 'PartisanRight']",Far Right,False,4,yN3WZUgYcV0,3,Jo Jorgensen

Script:

Once upon a time, every student of history – and that meant pretty much everyone with a high school education – knew this: The Democratic Party was the party of slavery and Jim Crow, and the Republican Party was the party of emancipation and racial integration.

Democrats were the Confederacy and Republicans were the Union. Jim Crow Democrats were dominant in the South and socially tolerant Republicans were dominant in the North.

But then, in the 1960s and 70s, everything supposedly flipped: suddenly the Republicans became the racists and the Democrats became the champions of civil rights.

Fabricated by left-leaning academic elites and journalists, the story went like this: Republicans couldn't win a national election by appealing to the better nature of the country; they could only win by appealing to the worst. Attributed to Richard Nixon, the media's all-purpose bad guy, this came to be known as ""The Southern Strategy.""

It was very simple. Win elections by winning the South. And to win the South, appeal to racists. So, the Republicans, the party of Lincoln, were to now be labeled the party of rednecks.

But this story of the two parties switching identities is a myth. In fact, it's three myths wrapped into one false narrative.

Let's take a brief look at each myth in turn.

Myth Number One: In order to be competitive in the South, Republicans started to pander to white racists in the 1960s.

Fact: Republicans actually became competitive in the South as early as 1928, when Republican Herbert Hoover won over 47 percent of the South's popular vote against Democrat Al Smith. In 1952, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower won the southern states of Tennessee, Florida and Virginia. And in 1956, he picked up Louisiana, Kentucky and West Virginia, too. And that was after he supported the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education that desegregated public schools; and after he sent the 101st Airborne to Little Rock Central High School to enforce integration.

* Correction: President Eisenhower ordered 101st Airborne to Little Rock, Arkansas, in September 1957; that is, after the 1956 Presidential election, not as stated in the video, before the election.

Myth Number Two: Southern Democrats, angry with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, switched parties.

Fact: Of the 21 Democratic senators who opposed the Civil Rights Act, just one became a Republican. The other 20 continued to be elected as Democrats, or were replaced by other Democrats. On average, those 20 seats didn't go Republican for another two-and-a-half decades.

Myth Number Three: Since the implementation of the Southern Strategy, the Republicans have dominated the South.

Fact: Richard Nixon, the man who is often credited with creating the Southern Strategy, lost the Deep South in 1968. In contrast, Democrat Jimmy Carter nearly swept the region in 1976 - 12 years after the Civil Rights Act of 1964. And in 1992, over 28 years later, Democrat Bill Clinton won Georgia, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia. The truth is, Republicans didn't hold a majority of southern congressional seats until 1994, 30 years after the Civil Rights Act.

Script:

I recently watched a group of protestors, most of them young, denouncing President Donald Trump’s immigration policies. They were waving Mexican flags and shouting: “¡Si, se puede!”—""Yes, we can!” 

This is now the rallying cry of the open-borders left, but it wasn’t always. In fact, I wondered if a single person at the protest knew where it came from. 

The slogan first became famous fifty years ago, thanks to Cesar Chavez. He was the founder of the United Farm Workers union. When Chavez said “Si, se puede,” he meant something very different: “Yes, we can… seal the borders.”

Cesar Chavez hated illegal immigration. 

He was Hispanic, obviously, and definitely on the left, but he fought to keep illegal Mexican immigrants out of this country. He understood that peasants from Latin America will always work for less than Americans will. That’s why employers prefer them. Chavez knew that. “As long as we have a poor country bordering California,” he once explained, “it’s going to be very difficult to win strikes.”

In 1969, Chavez led a march down the center of California to protest the hiring of illegal immigrant produce pickers. Marching alongside him was Democratic Senator Walter Mondale, and the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, the longtime aide to Martin Luther King. 

Ten years later, Chavez dispatched armed union members into the desert to assault Mexican nationals who were trying to sneak across the border. Chavez’s men beat immigrants with chains and whips made of barbed wire. Illegal aliens who dared to work as scabs had their houses fire-bombed and their cars burned. 

Chavez wasn’t embarrassed about any of this. He bragged about it. 

No matter. Chavez remains a progressive hero. President Obama declared his birthday a commemorative federal holiday.  It’s an official day off in half a dozen states.  There’s a college named after him, and dozens of public schools. 

 Cesar Chavez’s life is a reminder of how much the left has changed—and how quickly. 

Until recently, most Democrats agreed with Chavez. They opposed unchecked immigration because they knew it hurt American workers. And they were right.  

One study by a Harvard economist examined the effects of the mass migration of Cuban refugees to this country in 1980—the so-called Mariel boatlift. He found that American workers in Miami with a high school education saw their wages fall by more than thirty percent after the refugees arrived. If you believe in supply and demand, this is not surprising. 

After the fall of Saigon in 1975, Democratic Governor Jerry Brown opposed letting Vietnamese refugees into California on the grounds that the state already had enough poor people. As he put it at the time, ""There is something a little strange about saying, 'Let's bring in 500,000 more people' when we can't take care of the one million Californians out of work.”

First term Senator Joe Biden of Delaware agreed; he introduced federal legislation to curb the arrival of the Vietnamese.

Script:

We're supposed to be the United States of America. But in many ways, we're now divided into two very different nations.

There is red state America.

And there is blue state America.

The red states favor conservative, small government, free market policies: low taxes, light regulation, tough-on-crime policing, and worker freedom. Think Florida, Texas, Tennessee, Arizona, and Utah.

The blue states favor a liberal/left, big government approach: high taxes, heavy regulations, high minimum wages, and mandatory union membership. Think New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Illinois, Oregon, and, of course, California.

Progressives like to argue that their big-government, high tax policies are economically superior and thus better for the poor, minorities and working-class Americans than those of red states. Conservative policies, progressives contend, are culturally backward, and tilted to benefit the rich.

Let's test this thesis by comparing three of the largest red states: Florida, Texas, and Tennessee with three of the largest blue states: California, New York, and Illinois.

If progressive policies really work, then Americans should be rushing to get into the blue states.

But just the opposite is happening.

Americans are packing up their U-Hauls and heading to the red states. According to the New York Times, in August 2020, so many people wanted to leave New York City that moving companies were turning away business. They just couldn't handle the demand.

This exodus may be accelerating, but it's not new.

Over the last decade the three big blue states each lost an average of one million people to other states, while the three big red states gained almost a million from other states.

Makes perfect sense. Americans like freedom. Small government means more freedom.

And freedom means opportunity.

Let's say you're looking for a job. Over the last decade, Florida, Texas and Tennessee have gained twice as many jobs as the progressive states.

Not only that, but your money goes further in red states. According to a 2019 Tax Foundation study, your $100 stretches to $111 in purchasing power in Tennessee, while in New Jersey it shrinks to $89.

If you're a big corporation or a small company looking for a business-friendly environment, affordable housing or maybe just a better quality of life, where are you going to go?

The tough decision is not choosing a red state or a blue state. The tough decision is which red state to move to.

Progressives like to say that this isn't about economics, it's about weather. The red states tend to be in the South and southwest where the weather is warmer.

But that doesn't explain why so many people are leaving California which has the best weather in the country.

So, what does explain the migration from blue states?

Start with taxes. The two most populous blue states — California and New York — have the highest tax rates in America, while the two most populous red states — Texas and Florida — have no income tax at all.

When taxes get too high, people move to where taxes are lower. The problem for the high-tax states is that these people take their money, their ambition, and their employees with them.

Then, there is crime.

Do blue cities do better than red cities?

The answer, of course, is no. Of the twenty cities with the highest murder rates, 18 are run by left-leaning Democrats — and for the most part, have been for decades. And these cities aren't getting safer; they're getting more dangerous.

A good chunk of Minneapolis was burned to the ground as a result of riots, following the death of George Floyd.

Script:

I was elected to the Parliament of Canada seven times—three times as Prime Minister. I did not expect Donald Trump to be elected President of the United States. But unlike most observers, I did think it was at least possible. Why?

Because I sensed, as Mr. Trump surely did, that the political landscape had shifted. 

The underlying issue is this:  Over the last few decades, thanks to globalization, a billion people—mostly in the emerging markets of Asia—have lifted themselves out of poverty. This, of course, is a good thing. Yet, in many Western countries, the incomes of working people have stagnated or even declined over the same period.

In short, many Americans voted for Donald Trump because the global economy has not been working for them. We can pretend that this is a false perception. We can keep trying to convince people that they misunderstand their own lives. Or we can try to understand what they are saying and offer some solutions. 

I prefer the latter approach.

Let me begin with this:

In our contemporary world, there are, as British journalist David Goodhart describes it, those who can live “Anywhere,” and those who live “Somewhere.”

Imagine you work for an international bank, computer company, or consulting firm.  You can wake up in New York, London, or Singapore and feel at home. Your work is not threatened by import competition or technological dislocation. You vocally support all international trade agreements and high levels of immigration. You are one of those who can live Anywhere. There are a lot of those people. But there are a lot more completely unlike them.

Let’s say you’re a factory worker, a small-businessperson, or in retail sales. Your work has been disrupted by outsourcing, cheap imports and technological change. Your children attend the local schools and your aging parents live nearby. Your social life is connected to a local church, sports team, or community group.

If things go badly at your company, or if policy choices by politicians turn out to be wrong, you can’t just shift your life to somewhere else. Like it or not, you depend on the economic policies of your national or state government. When it doesn’t come through for you, you’re not happy. And when it ignores you entirely, you get angry.

It’s easy for Anywheres to dismiss these concerns. But the Anywheres’ faith in global solutions and multi-national political bodies is founded more on fantasy than fact. 

The fact is, the critical functions of laws and regulations and monetary and fiscal stability, among other things, are provided by nations, not global institutions.

The nation, with all its flaws, is a concrete reality. The “global community” is little more than a concept. Yet it is the Anywheres, with their faith in globalization—not the Somewheres—who have dominated the politics of almost every advanced country.

That is, until now.

This sea-change is not limited to the United States.  The same dynamics—“Anywhere” elites versus “Somewhere” populists—is playing out all across the Western world.

These populists, as I’ve tried to show, are not the ignorant and misguided “deplorables” depicted in mainstream media. They are our family, friends, and neighbors. The populists represent, by definition, the interests of ordinary people. And, in a democratic system, the people are supposed to be our customers.

Today’s Republican Party opposes big government. It’s culturally conservative. Its demographic support is strongest among white voters, and it usually dominates elections in the South. And its 2016 presidential nominee has been heavily criticized for inciting racial tensions.

But things weren’t always this way. 

Over the past 160 or so years, the party has undergone a remarkable transformation from the party of Abraham Lincoln… to the party of Donald Trump.

Script:

I’m an atmospheric physicist. I’ve published more than 200 scientific papers. For 30 years I taught at MIT, during which time the climate has changed remarkably little. But the cry of “global warming” has grown ever more shrill. In fact, it seems that the less the climate changes, the louder the voices of the climate alarmists get. So, let’s clear the air and create a more accurate picture of where we really stand on the issue of global warming or, as it is now called—“climate change.” 

There are basically three groups of people dealing with this issue. Groups one and two are scientists. Group three consists mostly, at its core, of politicians, environmentalists and the media. 

Group one is associated with the scientific part of the United Nation’s International Panel on Climate Change or IPCC (Working Group 1). These are scientists who mostly believe that recent climate change is primarily due to man’s burning of fossil fuels—oil, coal and natural gas. This releases C02, carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere and, they believe, this might eventually dangerously heat the planet. 

Group two is made up of scientists who don’t see this as an especially serious problem. This is the group I belong to. We’re usually referred to as skeptics. 

We note that there are many reasons why the climate changes—the sun, clouds, oceans, the orbital variations of the earth, as well as a myriad of other inputs. None of these is fully understood, and there is no evidence that CO2 emissions are the dominant factor.  

But actually there is much agreement between both groups of scientists. The following are such points of agreement:

1) The climate is always changing. 

2) CO2 is a greenhouse gas without which life on earth is not possible, but adding it to the atmosphere should lead to some warming.

3) Atmospheric levels of CO2 have been increasing since the end of the Little Ice Age in the 19th century. 

4) Over this period (the past two centuries), the global mean temperature has increased slightly and erratically by about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit or one degree Celsius; but only since the 1960’s have man’s greenhouse emissions been sufficient to play a role. 

5) Given the complexity of climate, no confident prediction about future global mean temperature or its impact can be made. The IPCC acknowledged in its own 2007 report that “The long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.”

Check out the show notes here: https://www.lewishowes.com/742

Ben Shapiro is editor-in-chief of The Daily Wire and host of “The Ben Shapiro Show,” the top conservative podcast in the nation. Ben is the New York Times bestselling author of seven nonfiction books and is constantly featured on major newspapers and websites.

Ben believes that people need to look within when they have a problem. He’s more interested in root values than debating specific issues.

He ruffles a lot of feathers and I don’t agree with everything he says, but I still think you’re going to enjoy this one.

So get ready to learn about going from victimhood to a powerful mindset on Episode 742.

Some Questions I Ask:
Why are you so passionate about your message? (3:00)
How do you avoid judging people you disagree with (6:00)
Who was the most influential person in your life growing up? (17:00)
What’s the most important lesson you’ve learned from your mom? (35:00)
What’s your most proud moment growing up? (57:30)
What is your purpose moving forward? (1:15:00)

His video caused concern and sparked conversation.

f-wWBGo6a2w,Jordan B Peterson,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,1495326098.0,Biblical Series I: Introduction to the Idea of God,"Lecture I in my Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories series from May 16th at Isabel Bader Theatre in Toronto. In this lecture, I describe what I consider to be the idea of God, which is at least partly the notion of sovereignty and power, divorced from any concrete sovereign or particular, individual person of power. I also suggest that God, as Father, is something akin to the spirit or pattern inherent in the human hierarchy of authority, which is based in turn on the dominance hierarchies characterizing animals.
