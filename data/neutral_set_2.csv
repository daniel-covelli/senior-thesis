11,_zhWHsfEa0U,Sky News Australia,UCO0akufu9MOzyz3nvGIXAAw,1603033305.0,EXCLUSIVE: Joe Biden's son emailed shop owner about hard drive to 'get it back': Former Trump chief,"Steve Bannon, former chief strategist to President Donald Trump, has revealed Joe Biden's son emailed a shop owner who had his hard drive in an effort to get it back.

The revelations come as the New York Post this week released an expose detailing links between Joe Biden and his son who was paid at least $50,000 a month to sit on the board of a Ukrainian energy company who allegedly set up a meeting with the then-Vice President.

Information regarding Hunter Biden’s relationship with the Ukranian energy company was sourced from a collection of emails recovered from a laptop that was allegedly dropped off at a repair shop in 2019 and later given to the FBI.

It was a water-damaged MacBook Pro and the person who dropped it off never paid for the service and didn't retrieve it or a hard drive on which its contents were stored - according to the shop owner who said he repeatedly tried to contact the customer.
 
Sky News host Sharri Markson said the owner of the repair shop in Biden's home state of Delaware says when he did not hear back from the FBI, he made a copy of the hard drive and gave it to Donald Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
 

Emails on the laptop revealed that Hunter Biden had planned to introduce his father – the then-Vice President – to an executive at Ukrainian energy company Burisma, a company where Hunter served on the board of directors.

Publicly, Biden has said he's never spoken to his son about his overseas business dealings. These emails seem to indicate otherwise.
 
In one message sent by Vadym Pozharsky in April 2015, he wrote: ""Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent (sic) some time together. It's realty (sic) an honour and pleasure.""

In response to this news, Facebook and Twitter both censored the article from the New York Post, advising they were ""limiting the distribution"" of the story on their platforms until a third-party contractor can ""fact check"" the article.

Mr Bannon told Ms Markson, “Hunter Biden’s lawyer has come to us both with phone calls and with emails saying, ‘hey, I’ve got to get the hard drive back’.”

“This is not some Russian intelligence operation; they admit it’s their hard drive,” Mr Bannon said.

“We have the emails from the Lawyer, if we need to release them, we’ll release them.”",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_zhWHsfEa0U/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-22 12:52:01.646658,1.3333333333333333,"['PartisanRight', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanRight']",Right,False,1,eGYFWNtW2QA

21,_zhWHsfEa0U,Sky News Australia,UCO0akufu9MOzyz3nvGIXAAw,1603033305.0,EXCLUSIVE: Joe Biden's son emailed shop owner about hard drive to 'get it back': Former Trump chief,"Steve Bannon, former chief strategist to President Donald Trump, has revealed Joe Biden's son emailed a shop owner who had his hard drive in an effort to get it back.

The revelations come as the New York Post this week released an expose detailing links between Joe Biden and his son who was paid at least $50,000 a month to sit on the board of a Ukrainian energy company who allegedly set up a meeting with the then-Vice President.

Information regarding Hunter Biden’s relationship with the Ukranian energy company was sourced from a collection of emails recovered from a laptop that was allegedly dropped off at a repair shop in 2019 and later given to the FBI.

It was a water-damaged MacBook Pro and the person who dropped it off never paid for the service and didn't retrieve it or a hard drive on which its contents were stored - according to the shop owner who said he repeatedly tried to contact the customer.
 
Sky News host Sharri Markson said the owner of the repair shop in Biden's home state of Delaware says when he did not hear back from the FBI, he made a copy of the hard drive and gave it to Donald Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
 

Emails on the laptop revealed that Hunter Biden had planned to introduce his father – the then-Vice President – to an executive at Ukrainian energy company Burisma, a company where Hunter served on the board of directors.

Publicly, Biden has said he's never spoken to his son about his overseas business dealings. These emails seem to indicate otherwise.
 
In one message sent by Vadym Pozharsky in April 2015, he wrote: ""Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent (sic) some time together. It's realty (sic) an honour and pleasure.""

In response to this news, Facebook and Twitter both censored the article from the New York Post, advising they were ""limiting the distribution"" of the story on their platforms until a third-party contractor can ""fact check"" the article.

Mr Bannon told Ms Markson, “Hunter Biden’s lawyer has come to us both with phone calls and with emails saying, ‘hey, I’ve got to get the hard drive back’.”

“This is not some Russian intelligence operation; they admit it’s their hard drive,” Mr Bannon said.

“We have the emails from the Lawyer, if we need to release them, we’ll release them.”",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_zhWHsfEa0U/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-22 12:52:02.027867,1.3333333333333333,"['PartisanRight', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanRight']",Right,False,2,OURWgjDhc8M

They battled over the economy, the coronavirus pandemic, race, and election integrity. Moderator Fox News anchor Chris Wallace selected the topics.

60,9HnKFUNlcfY,CBS News,UC8p1vwvWtl6T73JiExfWs1g,1600748639.0,Trump and Biden face off in chaotic first 2020 presidential debate | FULL DEBATE,"The first presidential debate between President Trump and Joe Biden featured a chaotic series of bitter exchanges and name-calling, with the president repeatedly speaking over his Democratic rival and the moderator struggling to maintain control of the 90-minute affair.

""Will you shut up, man?"" an exasperated Biden said in a comment that was emblematic of the tumultuous nature of the debate, which was held in Cleveland, Ohio. ""It's hard to get any word in with this clown.""

The president leveled barrages of unfounded accusations against his Democratic rival and his family, invoking his son Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine and bringing up the younger Biden's history of drug abuse. Mr. Trump declined to condemn white supremacist groups and defended his response to the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed more than 200,000 American lives, trying to portray Biden as a socialist who isn't equipped to occupy the Oval Office.

""Did you use the word smart?"" the president asked Biden at one point. ""You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don't ever use the word smart with me, Joe.""

Biden, for his part, tried to direct his answers to the audience watching at home. He called Mr. Trump ""the worst president America has ever had,"" blaming him for bungling the response to the pandemic and fueling racial divisions amid recent protests against police brutality.

Over 40 million people in the United States live below the poverty line, twice as many as it was fifty years ago. It can happen very quickly.


Many people in the United States fall through the social safety net. In the structurally weak mining region of the Appalachians, it has become almost normal for people to go shopping with food stamps. And those who lose their home often have no choice but to live in a car. There are so many homeless people in Los Angeles that relief organizations have started to build small wooden huts to provide them with a roof over their heads. The number of homeless children has also risen dramatically, reaching 1.5 million, three times more than during the Great Depression the 1930s. A documentary about the fate of the poor in the United States today.

The President of the United States is often referred to as the most powerful man in the world. But Donald Trump’s niece, Mary Trump says the current POTUS is really the most dangerous man in the world. She is so troubled by Trump’s abuse of his position that she says it’s her patriotic duty to take him down. And to do that she has written a brutal tell-all memoir. As Liam Bartlett discovers in an Australian television exclusive interview, the book is the ultimate insider’s account of a truly dysfunctional family. But it has added substance because Doctor Mary Trump is also a clinical psychologist. Her analysis of how her Uncle Don became Uncle Sam is not just a page-turner, it’s a horror story.

77,qAxQltlGodA,FRONTLINE PBS | Official,UC3ScyryU9Oy9Wse3a8OAmYQ,1599619207.0,Growing Up Poor In America (full film) | FRONTLINE,"The documentary, ""Growing Up Poor in America"", follows three children and their families in the battleground state of Ohio as the COVID-19 pandemic amplifies their struggle to stay afloat.

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: http://www.pbs.org/donate

In early 2020, it was estimated that almost 12 million children in America were living in poverty — a burden disproportionately borne by Black and Latino kids. Then came the coronavirus.

Director Jezza Neumann, who made 2012's “Poor Kids,” once again delves into how poverty impacts children. As the pandemic continues, the presidential election approaches and America reckons with racism, FRONTLINE offers a powerful look at child poverty in the time of COVID-19 — told from the perspective of the children themselves. The film is supported by the WNET “Chasing the Dream” initiative.

""We have a Constitution. And we have to follow that Constitution. And the President has drifted away from it,"" Powell, a retired general who served under President George W. Bush, told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union.""
The comments from Powell, the first African American secretary of state and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, add to a growing list of rebukes made in recent days by former top officials who have expressed discontent with Trump's strongman approach to the protests sparked by the death of Floyd, a black man who was killed in late May by a white police officer in Minneapolis.

In other words, a Democratic landslide could be coming. CNN’s Chris Cillizza explains how this potential wave will crash hardest -- and with the most impact -- at the state legislative level. 

About me: 
I was named ""best dressed"" in 7th grade. That, along with being CNN's editor at large and author of the daily ""Point"" newsletter are my proudest achievements. Look for me here every Tuesday and Thursday to find out what’s really going down in politics.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Correction: At 4:28, a previous version of this video read  ""Federal Drug Administration."" It should read ""Food and Drug Administration.""

Dr. Anthony Fauci has become one of the most recognizable faces of the United States’ coronavirus response, as a member of the Coronavirus Task Force and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. But it was an earlier crisis that shaped his career — and that’s crucial to understand his position today.

As the above video shows, Dr. Fauci’s involvement in the AIDS crisis, from the virus’s discovery to the present day, has affected the course of his career and the way the disease is treated around the world. That history, in turn, informs how we learn about and treat the coronavirus today.

In addition to scientific progress, AIDS also necessitated bureaucratic changes in the government response to the disease. By negotiating these challenges, Dr. Fauci secured his place in the public health system and changed how AIDS was treated.

Further Reading:

A topic as broad as the AIDS crisis, even narrowed to Dr. Fauci’s involvement, could have an endless reading list, from primary sources like ACT UP’s historical archive (https://actupny.org/documents/nyplPR.html) or one of Dr. Fauci’s early lectures on AIDs https://collections.nlm.nih.gov/catalog/nlm:nlmuid-101674642-vid.

However, these books provide particularly useful context on a complex story.

Against the Odds: The Story of of AIDS Drug Development, Politics, and Profits by Peter Arno and Karyn Feiden
https://archive.org/details/againstodds00pete/page/258/mode/2up

This book provides an exhaustive tour of the AIDS crisis from a drug research perspective, with extensive coverage of the NIH and FDA.

Big Shot: Passion, Politics, and the Struggle for an AIDS Vaccine by Patricia Thomas
https://archive.org/details/bigshotpassionpo00thom/
This book extends beyond the 1980s period covered in this video to explore the long search for an AIDS vaccine. It’s highly useful as a history of pharmaceutical and government efforts.

How to Survive a Plague by David France
https://www.google.com/books/edition/How_to_Survive_a_Plague/LIqxCwAAQBAJ
This book, and the documentary of the same name, describe the activist history of the crisis with plenty of research into the government response.

AIDS at 30: A History by Victoria Harden and Anthony A. Fauci
https://www.google.com/books/edition/AIDS_at_30/QosAu8D4ELEC
Written by a former NIH history director and Dr. Fauci, this is something like an “official” history of the AIDs crisis, from the beginning to the book’s 2012 publication date.

Dr. Fauci, M.D., is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health and a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. He oversees an extensive portfolio of basic and applied research to prevent, diagnose, and treat established infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis and malaria as well as emerging diseases such as Ebola and Zika. He is the recipient of many prestigious awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the National Medal of Science.

A classics major with a premedical concentration at Holy Cross, he has often credited his professional success to the Jesuit intellectual rigor that was a core part of his education at the College, which also instilled in him a lifelong commitment to social justice, more important than ever in these currently unsettling times.


The forum is sponsored by the Rev. Michael C. McFarland, S.J. Center for Religion, Ethics and Culture at the College of the Holy Cross.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/f1B66EteGZ8/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-22 12:52:49.473411,0.0,['None'],Neutral,False,2,IA4UeltYUiw

Michael Mina, of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, talks about the evidence supporting the move from highly sensitive PCR-based viral tests to more rapid, cheaper, and less sensitive tests. Trevor Bedford, of the University of Washington and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, describes his theory that, in hard-hit regions, we may be closer to herd immunity than previously thought. Finally, Emily Silverman and Ashley McMullen, both of UCSF, discuss the role of the narrative in deepening our understanding of Covid by giving voice to clinicians and patients.
