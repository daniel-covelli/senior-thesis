Charlie Hopkinson is a comedic impressionist, impersonator, voice guy, whatever you want to call it who specialises in voices from current television shows and films. His standup is a character act about a retired maths teacher, his standup set includes impressions of Sir David Attenborough, Robin Williams, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Peaky Blinders, Tommy and Arthur Shelby and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.

Always looking to update my roster I look to try out subscriber suggested impressions in the impressions challenge series before honing the best ones. Recently I have added Peaky Blinders and Marvel / Avengers characters to my arsenal!

I currently run a number of series including:
Impression Reels - The very best impressions I can do, Including LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Cartoons .etc
Impression Challenges - Trying out new impressions in a less polished form.
Impression Dramatic song covers - Voices of Reason.
Low Budget Animation - Stickman sketch remakes of Iconic Tv shows and movies.
How to do Impressions - An audience lead tutorial series where I attempt to pass on my Impressions knowledge.
Dubs - Comedic dubs of iconic scenes with new dialogue, (My Peaky Blinders and Lord of The Rings dubs have grossed over 6 million views on Facebook)
Standup - Clips from Standup sets I have performed over the last year.
Comedy Sketches - Comedy Sketches

I started learning impressions in 2012, at the age of 20. You can follow my full impressions journey in my new ‘How to do impressions’ tutorial series

After graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date ‘Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions’ with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a ‘full time Youtuber’ was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity ‘Teach First’.

While teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series ‘Lookalikes’ as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.

Charlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.

Since the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.

His top impressions include:

Morgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)
Sir Ian McKellen (Gandalf – Lord of the Rings)
Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman – Breaking Bad)
Alan Rickman (Snape – Harry Potter)
Michael Caine (Alfred – Batman)
Jon Snow (Game of Thrones)
Jack Sparrow (Pirates of the Carribean)
Christoph Waltz (Django Unchained, Inglorious bastards)
Alec Guiness (Ben Kenobi – Star Wars)
Agent Smith (The Matrix)
Sean Bean (Boromir – Lord of the Rings)
Richard Armitage (Thorin Oakenshield – The Hobbit)

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA TO KICK OFF SEASON 7 OF
 
JERRY SEINFELD'S 
COMEDIANS IN CARS GETTING COFFEE

President Barack Obama will be Jerry Seinfeld's first guest when the seventh season of his online talk show, ""Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"" opens Dec. 30.
The show features the New York comedian picking up fellow comics in classic cars and taking them out for coffee and conversation.
Obama and Seinfeld spoke at the White House earlier this month. The White House says they took turns circling the South Lawn in a 1963 Corvette Stingray split window coupe before chatting over coffee in a basement dining room. They spoke about what makes White House life both remarkable and routine.
The appearance is another example of Obama trying to appeal to new audiences.

As votes continue to be counted, Donald Trump accuses the Democrats of trying to steal the election. Video of Bernie accurately predicting what would happen on election night goes viral. GOP Sources report the President threw a “temper tantrum” after seeing results favouring Joe Biden. A Fox News Poll shows Americans across the country hold progressive values. All members of “the Squad” won reelection last night, with progressives like Jamal Bowman and Cori Bush also picking up wins in their respective races. New data shows the USPS failed to deliver thousands of absentee ballots around the country before the cut-off times.

""The FBI is reportedly investigating a Saturday incident in which Trump supporters, many of whom were allegedly armed, used their vehicles to swarm a Biden-Harris campaign bus that was traveling on an interstate in Central Texas. As my colleague Ali Breland noted yesterday, neither Joe Biden nor Kamala Harris was on the bus traveling from San Antonio to Austin, but the startling episode prompted the campaign to cancel a scheduled event. CNN reported Sunday that according to a law enforcement source, the bureau is now looking into the matter.

The incident was one of several around the country this weekend to prompt accusations of harassment and intimidation, with pro-Trump motorists seen blocking traffic and shutting down bridges in support of the president on the final weekend before the election. ""

""The German lender Deutsche Bank is seeking to cut ties with President Donald Trump after the election, three senior officials at the bank told Reuters on Tuesday.

Deutsche Bank could seek to sell or demand repayment of about $340 million in outstanding loans to the Trump Organization, the report said.

Trump's ties with Deutsche Bank have long been scrutinized. Over the years the bank has become the biggest lender to the Trump Organization, the umbrella company for Trump's hotels, golf resorts, and other businesses.""

t2Lbh3OCWzY,Democracy Now!,UCzuqE7-t13O4NIDYJfakrhw,1604529645.0,"Election Too Close to Call: Biden Underperforms & Trump Stokes Chaos, Claiming False Victory","President Trump has prematurely declared victory and falsely accused Democrats of “major fraud,” even as millions of ballots continue to be counted across the United States amid an unprecedented wave of mail-in ballots widely believed to favor Democratic challenger Joe Biden. The two campaigns appear neck and neck in several battleground states key to winning the White House, but early results suggest Democrats performed worse than they had hoped, setting up a potential legal fight over uncounted ballots reminiscent of the 2000 election. We spend the hour discussing the results and what comes next, with Ben Jealous, president of People for the American Way and former head of the NAACP; Briahna Joy Gray, formerly the national press secretary for the 2020 Bernie Sanders campaign, and co-host of the “Bad Faith” podcast; and The Nation’s John Nichols in the battleground state of Wisconsin. “The tragedy of this election, regardless of what the outcome ends up being, is that it was ever this close at all,” says Gray. “The crime here is that the vote is this close.”

DweCuWFPJ9Q,NowThis News,UCn4sPeUomNGIr26bElVdDYg,1604537255.0,Live 2020 Election Results Tracker | LIVE | NowThis,"LIVE RESULTS—BIDEN WINS MORE VOTES THAN ANY CANDIDATE IN U.S. HISTORY: We’re tracking the latest 2020 results. Overnight, Joe Biden developed narrow leads in key battlegrounds Wisconsin and Michigan, with Trump’s path in both states ‘looking bleak,’ according to a NY Times analysis of the outstanding votes. If Biden were to capture Michigan, ‘he would have the advantage in states that would push his total past the 270-electoral-vote threshold’ to win, the Times noted. Nationally, Biden has now received more votes for president than any other candidate in U.S. election history, with over 69.5 million. He leads Trump by roughly 3 million votes total, with millions more left to be counted. If the current trend holds, Democrats will have won the popular vote in 7 of the last 8 presidential elections (1992, 1996, 2000, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020), despite not holding the White House for 12 of those years.

""Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE is looking for ways to end its relationship with President Donald Trump after the U.S. elections, as it tires of the negative publicity stemming from the ties, according to three senior bank officials with direct knowledge of the matter.

Deutsche Bank has about $340 million (262 million pounds) in loans outstanding to the Trump Organization, the president’s umbrella group that is currently overseen by his two sons, according to filings made by Trump to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics in July and a senior source within the bank. The three loans, which are against Trump properties and start coming due in two years, are current on payments and personally guaranteed by the president, according to two bank officials.

In meetings in recent months, a Deutsche Bank management committee that oversees reputational and other risks for the lender in the Americas region has discussed ways in which it could rid the bank of these last vestiges of the relationship, two of the three bank officials said. The bank has over the years lent Trump more than $2 billion, one of the officials said.""

""White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Tuesday predicted a “landslide” for President Donald Trump.

As voters went to the polls on Election Day, McEnany appeared on Fox News in her role as a Trump campaign adviser.

Fox News host Sandra Smith pointed out to McEnany that Trump has sought to undermine the counting of votes after election day in Pennsylvania. Experts have said that it could take up to three days to determine a winner in the commonwealth.""

Deutsche Bank could seek to sell or demand repayment of about $340 million in outstanding loans to the Trump Organization, the report said.

Trump's ties with Deutsche Bank have long been scrutinized. Over the years the bank has become the biggest lender to the Trump Organization, the umbrella company for Trump's hotels, golf resorts, and other businesses.""

SHiIHuIlEYk,The Damage Report,UCl9roQQwv4o4OuBj3FhQdDQ,1604540131.0,TDR Live: The Day After Tomorrow,"The Damage Report host John Iadarola is joined by TYT’s Jayar Jackson to break down the day’s top stories. 

As votes continue to be counted, Donald Trump accuses the Democrats of trying to steal the election. Video of Bernie accurately predicting what would happen on election night goes viral. GOP Sources report the President threw a “temper tantrum” after seeing results favouring Joe Biden. A Fox News Poll shows Americans across the country hold progressive values. All members of “the Squad” won reelection last night, with progressives like Jamal Bowman and Cori Bush also picking up wins in their respective races. New data shows the USPS failed to deliver thousands of absentee ballots around the country before the cut-off times.

""The FBI is reportedly investigating a Saturday incident in which Trump supporters, many of whom were allegedly armed, used their vehicles to swarm a Biden-Harris campaign bus that was traveling on an interstate in Central Texas. As my colleague Ali Breland noted yesterday, neither Joe Biden nor Kamala Harris was on the bus traveling from San Antonio to Austin, but the startling episode prompted the campaign to cancel a scheduled event. CNN reported Sunday that according to a law enforcement source, the bureau is now looking into the matter.

The incident was one of several around the country this weekend to prompt accusations of harassment and intimidation, with pro-Trump motorists seen blocking traffic and shutting down bridges in support of the president on the final weekend before the election. ""

t2Lbh3OCWzY,Democracy Now!,UCzuqE7-t13O4NIDYJfakrhw,1604529645.0,"Election Too Close to Call: Biden Underperforms & Trump Stokes Chaos, Claiming False Victory","President Trump has prematurely declared victory and falsely accused Democrats of “major fraud,” even as millions of ballots continue to be counted across the United States amid an unprecedented wave of mail-in ballots widely believed to favor Democratic challenger Joe Biden. The two campaigns appear neck and neck in several battleground states key to winning the White House, but early results suggest Democrats performed worse than they had hoped, setting up a potential legal fight over uncounted ballots reminiscent of the 2000 election. We spend the hour discussing the results and what comes next, with Ben Jealous, president of People for the American Way and former head of the NAACP; Briahna Joy Gray, formerly the national press secretary for the 2020 Bernie Sanders campaign, and co-host of the “Bad Faith” podcast; and The Nation’s John Nichols in the battleground state of Wisconsin. “The tragedy of this election, regardless of what the outcome ends up being, is that it was ever this close at all,” says Gray. “The crime here is that the vote is this close.”

Overnight, Joe Biden developed narrow leads in key battlegrounds Wisconsin and Michigan, with Trump’s path in both states ‘looking bleak,’ according to a NY Times analysis of the outstanding votes. If Biden were to capture Michigan, ‘he would have the advantage in states that would push his total past the 270-electoral-vote threshold’ to win, the Times noted. Nationally, Biden has now received more votes for president than any other candidate in U.S. election history, with over 69.5 million. He leads Trump by roughly 3 million votes total, with millions more left to be counted. If the current trend holds, Democrats will have won the popular vote in 7 of the last 8 presidential elections (1992, 1996, 2000, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020), despite not holding the White House for 12 of those years.

Over the past few decades, both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have moved away from the center. But the Republican Party has moved towards the extreme much more quickly -- a trend that political scientists’ call “asymmetrical polarization.”

That asymmetry poses a major obstacle in American politics. As Republicans have become more ideological, they’ve also become less willing to work with Democrats: filibustering Democratic legislation, refusing to consider Democratic appointees, and even shutting down the government in order to force Democrats to give in to their demands. 

Democrats have responded in turn, becoming more obstructionist as Republican demands become more extreme. 

And that’s made it really easy for media outlets to blame “both sides” for political gridlock. As political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein explain in their book “It’s Even Worse Than It Looks,” journalists feel a pressure to remain neutral when covering big political fights. So politics coverage has been dominated by the myth that both parties are equally to blame for the gridlock in DC. 

But they’re not. And the only way to stop Republicans in Congress from continuing their drift towards the extreme is to be brutally honest about who’s responsible for breaking our politics.

Putin's Kleptocracy: Who Owns Russia? By Karen Dawisha

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Vladimir Putin has been ruling Russia since 1999. In that time he has shaped the country into an authoritarian and militaristic society. The Soviet Union dissolved into 15 new countries, including the new Russian Federation. In Putin’s eyes, Russia had just lost 2 million square miles of territory. But Putin’s regime has also developed and fostered the most effect cyber hacker army in the world and he’s used it to wreak havoc in the West. But the election of Donald Trump brings new hope for the Putin vision. Trump’s rhetoric has been notably soft on Russia. He could lift sanctions and weaken NATO, potentially freeing up space for Putin’s Russia to become a dominant power once again.

Correction at 7:23: Cynthia's ancestors lived in Wilmington, not her descendants.

In November 1898, in Wilmington, North Carolina, a mob of 2,000 white men expelled black and white political leaders, destroyed the property of the city’s black residents, and killed dozens--if not hundreds--of people. How did such a turn of events change the course of the city? For decades, the story of this violence was buried, while the perpetrators were cast as heroes. Yet its impacts resonate across the state to this day.

In the new Vox series Missing Chapter, Vox Senior Producer Ranjani Chakraborty revisits underreported and often overlooked moments from the past to give context to the present. Join her as she covers the histories that are often left out of our textbooks. Our first season tackles stories of racial injustice, political conflicts, even the hidden history of US medical experimentation.

Watch more of our election coverage: http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

In the 2000 US presidential election, the Democratic candidate got half a million more votes than the Republican. The Democrat lost. Sixteen years later the same thing happened again. In the US, if you run for president, it does not actually matter how many people in the country vote for you. What matters instead is an arcane system for selecting America’s head of state called the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is the reason the US has something called “swing states,” and it’s the reason those places get to decide the future of the country. It’s the reason presidential candidates almost never campaign in the country’s biggest cities. And more recently, it’s also the reason that Republican candidates have been able to eke out victories in the presidential election without actually getting the most votes.

The Electoral College makes some Americans’ votes more powerful than others. In fact, that’s part of the reason we have it to begin with; in the country’s early years, the Electoral College helped give the votes of Southern Whites more weight than the votes of Northerners. The idea at its core, that certain votes simply matter more than others, is baked into the American tradition. In the 2020 election, it may decide the winner.

This video was produced in collaboration between Vox and BBCThree.

Over the course of her 63-year reign, Queen Victoria strategically planned marriages to place her descendants in royal families all over Europe. In doing so, she created one of the most remarkable royal families in history. 

By the early 19th century, Europe had been at war for decades. After the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars killed millions, European leaders came together to restore peace by reshaping major states for a new balance of power. Great Britain went on to become one of the strongest states. And years later, Queen Victoria and her husband Albert came up with a plan to maintain that political power — they married their children to monarchs across Europe. By the 1880s Queen Victoria’s children were in several important branches of Europe’s monarchies. 

The royal unions didn't play out as Queen Victoria planned, but she continued to make more matches anyway. She had 42 grandchildren, and these 7 ended up on royal thrones. Her grandchildren would end up on the thrones of Britain, Russia, Germany, Romania, Norway, and Spain leading up to the most destructive war Europe had ever seen.  

To truly understand the international conflicts and trends shaping our world you need a big-picture view. Video journalist Sam Ellis uses maps to tell these stories and chart their effects on foreign policy.

Follow Strikethrough on Facebook! https://www.facebook.com/CarlosMazaVox/

After eight years of attacking President Obama, Fox has happily adapted to its new role as a guard dog for the Trump administration. But the relationship between Fox and Trump is less of a romance and more of a hostage situation. Rupert Murdoch, Executive Chairman of News Corp (which owns Fox News), was a vocal critic of Trump during the 2016 campaign. He criticized Trump’s position on immigration, accused Trump of “embarrassing” the country, and was once described as “the billionaire Donald Trump can’t win over.”
So what explains Murdoch’s change of heart? Why is one of Trump’s most influential critics allowing his network to turn into a Trump PR channel?

After prohibition — the total ban on alcohol — many states established a minimum legal drinking age of 21. But that began to change after the voting age was lowered to 18. Many states followed by lowering their drinking ages, which changed the landscape for the entire country.

By the 1980s, this unusual patchwork of drinking ages started to be seen as a problem, especially by activist organizations like MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Drivers) and RID (Remove Intoxicated Drivers). They lobbied for a 21-year-old minimum legal drinking age, and President Ronald Reagan supported the cause. His mechanism for enabling a national law? Threatening to withhold Federal Highway funding to states that didn’t comply.

It was an unpredictable strategy for an official typically hesitant to use federal power over the states, and the practice was eventually challenged in the Supreme Court, where it was upheld.

Beyond the political clash, it’s a look at how roads shape policy.

Today’s Republican Party opposes big government. It’s culturally conservative. Its demographic support is strongest among white voters, and it usually dominates elections in the South. And its 2016 presidential nominee has been heavily criticized for inciting racial tensions.

But things weren’t always this way. 

Over the past 160 or so years, the party has undergone a remarkable transformation from the party of Abraham Lincoln… to the party of Donald Trump.

Watch more of our election coverage: http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

In the 2000 US presidential election, the Democratic candidate got half a million more votes than the Republican. The Democrat lost. Sixteen years later the same thing happened again. In the US, if you run for president, it does not actually matter how many people in the country vote for you. What matters instead is an arcane system for selecting America’s head of state called the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is the reason the US has something called “swing states,” and it’s the reason those places get to decide the future of the country. It’s the reason presidential candidates almost never campaign in the country’s biggest cities. And more recently, it’s also the reason that Republican candidates have been able to eke out victories in the presidential election without actually getting the most votes.

The Electoral College makes some Americans’ votes more powerful than others. In fact, that’s part of the reason we have it to begin with; in the country’s early years, the Electoral College helped give the votes of Southern Whites more weight than the votes of Northerners. The idea at its core, that certain votes simply matter more than others, is baked into the American tradition. In the 2020 election, it may decide the winner.

Fox News constantly accuses other news organizations of having a liberal bias, claiming networks like CNN and MSNBC are in bed with the Democratic Party. But over the past few years, major Fox personalities ike Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, and Jeanine Pirro have become more open about their support for the Republican Party -- appearing at GOP campaign events, speaking at Republican fundraisers, and even explicitly endorsing Republican candidates on air. Republican candidates have noticed, and have begun using friendly coverage on Fox as part of their campaign strategies. 

Fox News is transforming from a right-wing news network into a full-on Republican campaign operation. Pretty soon, people like Sean Hannity won’t have to leave their studio sets to be on the campaign trail.

You might have heard that the poor in America barely pay any taxes. And if you look at a chart of how much every American pays in income taxes, that seems basically true. But income taxes are just one type of the many taxes we pay. So what happens if we add them all up? A new analysis by the economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman did exactly that. And it shows that the American tax system might not be as ""progressive"" as many people believe.

Read more about that analysis in an op-ed Saez and Zucman wrote for the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/opinion/sunday/wealth-income-tax-rate.html

Tucker Carlson has branded himself as a populist, condemning the “liberal elite” that he argues makes up the American “ruling class.” It’s a good shtick, and it’s helped him stand out from other Fox News hosts. But while Tucker decries the “elite” on his show, he regularly ignores major stories of Republican economic policies that harm the working class, choosing instead to focus on bogus culture war stories.

That isn’t an accident. Carlson’s show is meant to distract Fox News viewers from Republican economics, channeling their frustration and anger at groups that don’t deserve it. That kind of misdirection produces what Marxist theorists call “false consciousness”: when workers are tricked into accepting their own exploitation.

“Don’t normalize this” has become a kind of rallying cry during President Trump’s first year in office -- a reminder to not get too acclimated to Trump’s norm-breaking and erratic behavior. 
But the real danger of the Trump presidency might have less to do with Trump’s abnormality and more to do with how “normal” he makes other Republicans look by comparison.

Republicans have broken politics.,"Neither party is perfect, but Republicans in Congress have been drifting towards political extremism since long before Trump, and they’re making it impossible for Congress to work the way it’s supposed to.

Over the past few decades, both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have moved away from the center. But the Republican Party has moved towards the extreme much more quickly -- a trend that political scientists’ call “asymmetrical polarization.”

That asymmetry poses a major obstacle in American politics. As Republicans have become more ideological, they’ve also become less willing to work with Democrats: filibustering Democratic legislation, refusing to consider Democratic appointees, and even shutting down the government in order to force Democrats to give in to their demands. 

Democrats have responded in turn, becoming more obstructionist as Republican demands become more extreme. 

And that’s made it really easy for media outlets to blame “both sides” for political gridlock. As political scientists Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein explain in their book “It’s Even Worse Than It Looks,” journalists feel a pressure to remain neutral when covering big political fights. So politics coverage has been dominated by the myth that both parties are equally to blame for the gridlock in DC. 

But they’re not. And the only way to stop Republicans in Congress from continuing their drift towards the extreme is to be brutally honest about who’s responsible for breaking our politics.

Vladimir Putin has been ruling Russia since 1999. In that time he has shaped the country into an authoritarian and militaristic society. The Soviet Union dissolved into 15 new countries, including the new Russian Federation. In Putin’s eyes, Russia had just lost 2 million square miles of territory. But Putin’s regime has also developed and fostered the most effect cyber hacker army in the world and he’s used it to wreak havoc in the West. But the election of Donald Trump brings new hope for the Putin vision. Trump’s rhetoric has been notably soft on Russia. He could lift sanctions and weaken NATO, potentially freeing up space for Putin’s Russia to become a dominant power once again.

Correction at 7:23: Cynthia's ancestors lived in Wilmington, not her descendants.

In November 1898, in Wilmington, North Carolina, a mob of 2,000 white men expelled black and white political leaders, destroyed the property of the city’s black residents, and killed dozens--if not hundreds--of people. How did such a turn of events change the course of the city? For decades, the story of this violence was buried, while the perpetrators were cast as heroes. Yet its impacts resonate across the state to this day.

In the new Vox series Missing Chapter, Vox Senior Producer Ranjani Chakraborty revisits underreported and often overlooked moments from the past to give context to the present.

Watch more of our election coverage: http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

In the 2000 US presidential election, the Democratic candidate got half a million more votes than the Republican. The Democrat lost. Sixteen years later the same thing happened again. In the US, if you run for president, it does not actually matter how many people in the country vote for you. What matters instead is an arcane system for selecting America’s head of state called the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is the reason the US has something called “swing states,” and it’s the reason those places get to decide the future of the country. It’s the reason presidential candidates almost never campaign in the country’s biggest cities. And more recently, it’s also the reason that Republican candidates have been able to eke out victories in the presidential election without actually getting the most votes.

The Electoral College makes some Americans’ votes more powerful than others. In fact, that’s part of the reason we have it to begin with; in the country’s early years, the Electoral College helped give the votes of Southern Whites more weight than the votes of Northerners. The idea at its core, that certain votes simply matter more than others, is baked into the American tradition. In the 2020 election, it may decide the winner.

This video was produced in collaboration between Vox and BBCThree.

Over the course of her 63-year reign, Queen Victoria strategically planned marriages to place her descendants in royal families all over Europe. In doing so, she created one of the most remarkable royal families in history. 

By the early 19th century, Europe had been at war for decades. After the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars killed millions, European leaders came together to restore peace by reshaping major states for a new balance of power. Great Britain went on to become one of the strongest states. And years later, Queen Victoria and her husband Albert came up with a plan to maintain that political power — they married their children to monarchs across Europe. By the 1880s Queen Victoria’s children were in several important branches of Europe’s monarchies. 

The royal unions didn't play out as Queen Victoria planned, but she continued to make more matches anyway. She had 42 grandchildren, and these 7 ended up on royal thrones. Her grandchildren would end up on the thrones of Britain, Russia, Germany, Romania, Norway, and Spain leading up to the most destructive war Europe had ever seen.  

To truly understand the international conflicts and trends shaping our world you need a big-picture view. Video journalist Sam Ellis uses maps to tell these stories and chart their effects on foreign policy.

After eight years of attacking President Obama, Fox has happily adapted to its new role as a guard dog for the Trump administration. But the relationship between Fox and Trump is less of a romance and more of a hostage situation. Rupert Murdoch, Executive Chairman of News Corp (which owns Fox News), was a vocal critic of Trump during the 2016 campaign. He criticized Trump’s position on immigration, accused Trump of “embarrassing” the country, and was once described as “the billionaire Donald Trump can’t win over.”
So what explains Murdoch’s change of heart? Why is one of Trump’s most influential critics allowing his network to turn into a Trump PR channel?

After prohibition — the total ban on alcohol — many states established a minimum legal drinking age of 21. But that began to change after the voting age was lowered to 18. Many states followed by lowering their drinking ages, which changed the landscape for the entire country.

By the 1980s, this unusual patchwork of drinking ages started to be seen as a problem, especially by activist organizations like MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Drivers) and RID (Remove Intoxicated Drivers). They lobbied for a 21-year-old minimum legal drinking age, and President Ronald Reagan supported the cause. His mechanism for enabling a national law? Threatening to withhold Federal Highway funding to states that didn’t comply.

It was an unpredictable strategy for an official typically hesitant to use federal power over the states, and the practice was eventually challenged in the Supreme Court, where it was upheld.

Beyond the political clash, it’s a look at how roads shape policy.

But over the past few years, major Fox personalities ike Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, and Jeanine Pirro have become more open about their support for the Republican Party -- appearing at GOP campaign events, speaking at Republican fundraisers, and even explicitly endorsing Republican candidates on air. Republican candidates have noticed, and have begun using friendly coverage on Fox as part of their campaign strategies. 

Fox News is transforming from a right-wing news network into a full-on Republican campaign operation. Pretty soon, people like Sean Hannity won’t have to leave their studio sets to be on the campaign trail.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

The US Senate is supposed to pass laws. But today, it’s broken. And it’s broken because of something called the filibuster, which has been part of Senate tradition for over 200 years. But the filibuster came into being by accident. And today, some politicians are suggesting we should get rid of it entirely.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

You might have heard that the poor in America barely pay any taxes. And if you look at a chart of how much every American pays in income taxes, that seems basically true. But income taxes are just one type of the many taxes we pay. So what happens if we add them all up? A new analysis by the economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman did exactly that. And it shows that the American tax system might not be as ""progressive"" as many people believe.

Read more about that analysis in an op-ed Saez and Zucman wrote for the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/opinion/sunday/wealth-income-tax-rate.html

All of their data, which we used to produce this video, is available on their website: https://taxjusticenow.org/

Their full research is presented in their book, the Triumph of Injustice: https://www.amazon.com/Triumph-Injustice-Rich-Dodge-Taxes/dp/1324002727

And if you want to watch a bunch of economists debate this research (economists got very fired up about this!), watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUGpjpEGTfE

Become a member of the Vox Video Lab! http://bit.ly/video-lab

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Tucker Carlson has branded himself as a populist, condemning the “liberal elite” that he argues makes up the American “ruling class.” It’s a good shtick, and it’s helped him stand out from other Fox News hosts. But while Tucker decries the “elite” on his show, he regularly ignores major stories of Republican economic policies that harm the working class, choosing instead to focus on bogus culture war stories.

That isn’t an accident. Carlson’s show is meant to distract Fox News viewers from Republican economics, channeling their frustration and anger at groups that don’t deserve it. That kind of misdirection produces what Marxist theorists call “false consciousness”: when workers are tricked into accepting their own exploitation.

“Don’t normalize this” has become a kind of rallying cry during President Trump’s first year in office -- a reminder to not get too acclimated to Trump’s norm-breaking and erratic behavior. 
But the real danger of the Trump presidency might have less to do with Trump’s abnormality and more to do with how “normal” he makes other Republicans look by comparison. And the concept of the “Overton Window” helps explain why our politics and media might be warped long after Trump’s presidency comes to an end.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_v-hzc6blGI/hqdefault.jpg,2020-11-04 10:32:49.147412,Left,-1.3333333333333333,"['PartisanLeft', 'SocialJustice', 'MissingLinkMedia', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanLeft', 'MissingLinkMedia', 'SocialJustice', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanLeft', 'SocialJustice', 'MissingLinkMedia', 'Mainstream News']",Left,False,4,mICxKmCjF-4,3,Republican Party

Charlie Hopkinson is a comedic impressionist, impersonator, voice guy, whatever you want to call it who specialises in voices from current television shows and films. His standup is a character act about a retired maths teacher, his standup set includes impressions of Sir David Attenborough, Robin Williams, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Peaky Blinders, Tommy and Arthur Shelby and Gandalf from Lord of the Rings.

Always looking to update my roster I look to try out subscriber suggested impressions in the impressions challenge series before honing the best ones. Recently I have added Peaky Blinders and Marvel / Avengers characters to my arsenal!

I currently run a number of series including:
Impression Reels - The very best impressions I can do, Including LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Cartoons .etc
Impression Challenges - Trying out new impressions in a less polished form.
Impression Dramatic song covers - Voices of Reason.
Low Budget Animation - Stickman sketch remakes of Iconic Tv shows and movies.
How to do Impressions - An audience lead tutorial series where I attempt to pass on my Impressions knowledge.
Dubs - Comedic dubs of iconic scenes with new dialogue, (My Peaky Blinders and Lord of The Rings dubs have grossed over 6 million views on Facebook)
Standup - Clips from Standup sets I have performed over the last year.
Comedy Sketches - Comedy Sketches

I started learning impressions in 2012, at the age of 20. You can follow my full impressions journey in my new ‘How to do impressions’ tutorial series

After graduating from the University of Warwick in the summer 2013 he took 4 months out to concentrate on Youtube videos full time, including producing his most viewed video to date ‘Morgan Freeman and 40 other impressions’ with just over 12 million views. This foray into being a ‘full time Youtuber’ was cut short as he went travelling for 3 months before starting a 2 year teaching Graduate scheme with Charity ‘Teach First’.

While teaching he has performed in and narrated the 4 episode series ‘Lookalikes’ as Morgan Freeman. The show and the narration received a positive reception. The show aired on Channel 4 during the prime time slot of Friday 10pm for three weeks. It is now currently available on Netflix. Charlie also performed with other well known impressionists for an unaired pilot.

Charlie has worked for several prominent brands in relation to their products, including google and formula 1.

Since the summer of 2016 Charlie has once again dived into the world of YouTube, for the first time producing content on a weekly basis. He is also focusing on live performance; he has performed in live venues a total of 3 times to date.

His top impressions include:

Morgan Freeman (Red -Shawshank redemption)
Sir Ian McKellen (Gandalf – Lord of the Rings)
Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman – Breaking Bad)
Alan Rickman (Snape – Harry Potter)
Michael Caine (Alfred – Batman)
Jon Snow (Game of Thrones)
Jack Sparrow (Pirates of the Carribean)
Christoph Waltz (Django Unchained, Inglorious bastards)
Alec Guiness (Ben Kenobi – Star Wars)
Agent Smith (The Matrix)
Sean Bean (Boromir – Lord of the Rings)
Richard Armitage (Thorin Oakenshield – The Hobbit)
Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister – Game of Thrones)
Tyrion Lannister (Game of Thrones)

JERRY SEINFELD'S 
COMEDIANS IN CARS GETTING COFFEE

President Barack Obama will be Jerry Seinfeld's first guest when the seventh season of his online talk show, ""Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"" opens Dec. 30.
The show features the New York comedian picking up fellow comics in classic cars and taking them out for coffee and conversation.
Obama and Seinfeld spoke at the White House earlier this month. The White House says they took turns circling the South Lawn in a 1963 Corvette Stingray split window coupe before chatting over coffee in a basement dining room. They spoke about what makes White House life both remarkable and routine.
The appearance is another example of Obama trying to appeal to new audiences.

With millions of legitimate ballots left to count, Donald Trump has declared an unsupported victory.

""Frankly we did win this election,"" he claims, speaking in subdued tone. He suggests - without evidence - that election ""fraud"" has occurred.

""This is an embarrassment to our country,"" he says, adding that he plans to go to the Supreme Court to fight election results.

Millions of votes in the 2020 election are yet to be counted and the president has no credibility in claiming a victory.
