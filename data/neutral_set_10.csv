KpljCyzyBsQ,Bloomberg Quicktake: Now,UChirEOpgFCupRAk5etXqPaA,1605676013.0,LIVE: Georgia Election Officials Give Briefing as Trump Attacks Mail-In Voting,"(Nov. 17) The Republican secretary of state in Georgia said he believes that President Donald Trump cost himself votes with his campaign to undermine mail-in voting.

Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said Trump’s frequent and unsubstantiated accusations of mail-in voting fraud likely contributed to 24,500 people who voted in the state’s Republican primary not voting in the Nov. 3 election -- possibly accounting for President-elect Joe Biden’s 14,000-vote advantage in the state.

“In effect, what you’re doing is you are suppressing your own voters,” Raffensperger said in a telephone interview. “I have no control over what campaigns do, and if they do ill-advised actions that suppress their own vote, what can I do?”

Raffensperger also said he believes Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, tried to urge him to throw out absentee ballots. The state official criticized what he called a “campaign of misinformation, disinformation and outright lies about the process in Georgia.”

The Trump campaign has said it’s found widespread voting irregularities but has cited little evidence to substantiate its claims and none has emerged. Trump and his allies have also filed lawsuits in the state. One, alleging that fewer than 60 absentee ballots in Chatham County were improperly counted, has already been dismissed, while another that seeks to stop the state from certifying results is pending.

Raffensperger said that the state, which is conducting a hand recount of 5 million ballots cast in the election, is on track to complete that process by Wednesday night’s deadline and that he doesn’t expect significant changes in the vote totals. The state will also certify the results by Friday if a court doesn’t intervene. Trump can ask for a recount after that with ballots run through scanners, he said.

Graham, a South Carolina Republican, disputed Raffensperger’s accusation that he urged the Georgia secretary of state to toss ballots, first reported in the Washington Post, calling it “ridiculous.

“What I’m trying to find is how do you verify signatures on mail-in ballots in these states that are the center of attention,” Graham said.

But Raffensperger said Graham and Trump aren’t taking into account how the signature-matching system has been strengthened, including the addition of an online portal to allow a photo identification to be used.

The secretary of state’s office has been batting down rumors and half-truths about the election almost daily, including from the Trump campaign, he said.

“It’s just an outright lie what people are saying,” Raffensperger said.

Georgia’s two Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, have called on Raffensperger to resign. Republican Representative Doug Collins, a close ally of the president who’s overseeing the recount for the campaign, has also criticized Raffensperger.

“I guess if you’re a shill for President Trump you can get away with it, no one holds him accountable,” Raffensperger said of Collins.

Raffensperger said the audit now being completed should give voters confidence in the results.

“The reason we’ve done an audit is that we make sure that every legal vote has been counted, and that should give people assurance that we’re making sure that it’s a thorough process so there can be no question afterwards,” he said.

KpljCyzyBsQ,Bloomberg Quicktake: Now,UChirEOpgFCupRAk5etXqPaA,1605676013.0,LIVE: Georgia Election Officials Give Briefing as Trump Attacks Mail-In Voting,"(Nov. 17) The Republican secretary of state in Georgia said he believes that President Donald Trump cost himself votes with his campaign to undermine mail-in voting.

Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said Trump’s frequent and unsubstantiated accusations of mail-in voting fraud likely contributed to 24,500 people who voted in the state’s Republican primary not voting in the Nov. 3 election -- possibly accounting for President-elect Joe Biden’s 14,000-vote advantage in the state.

“In effect, what you’re doing is you are suppressing your own voters,” Raffensperger said in a telephone interview. “I have no control over what campaigns do, and if they do ill-advised actions that suppress their own vote, what can I do?”

Raffensperger also said he believes Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, tried to urge him to throw out absentee ballots. The state official criticized what he called a “campaign of misinformation, disinformation and outright lies about the process in Georgia.”

The Trump campaign has said it’s found widespread voting irregularities but has cited little evidence to substantiate its claims and none has emerged. Trump and his allies have also filed lawsuits in the state. One, alleging that fewer than 60 absentee ballots in Chatham County were improperly counted, has already been dismissed, while another that seeks to stop the state from certifying results is pending.

Raffensperger said that the state, which is conducting a hand recount of 5 million ballots cast in the election, is on track to complete that process by Wednesday night’s deadline and that he doesn’t expect significant changes in the vote totals. The state will also certify the results by Friday if a court doesn’t intervene. Trump can ask for a recount after that with ballots run through scanners, he said.

Graham, a South Carolina Republican, disputed Raffensperger’s accusation that he urged the Georgia secretary of state to toss ballots, first reported in the Washington Post, calling it “ridiculous.

“What I’m trying to find is how do you verify signatures on mail-in ballots in these states that are the center of attention,” Graham said.

But Raffensperger said Graham and Trump aren’t taking into account how the signature-matching system has been strengthened, including the addition of an online portal to allow a photo identification to be used.

The secretary of state’s office has been batting down rumors and half-truths about the election almost daily, including from the Trump campaign, he said.

“It’s just an outright lie what people are saying,” Raffensperger said.

Georgia’s two Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, have called on Raffensperger to resign. Republican Representative Doug Collins, a close ally of the president who’s overseeing the recount for the campaign, has also criticized Raffensperger.

“I guess if you’re a shill for President Trump you can get away with it, no one holds him accountable,” Raffensperger said of Collins.

Raffensperger said the audit now being completed should give voters confidence in the results.

“The reason we’ve done an audit is that we make sure that every legal vote has been counted, and that should give people assurance that we’re making sure that it’s a thorough process so there can be no question afterwards,” he said.

We are waiting to see if essential workers will be paid hero’s pay or essential workers pay. We are waiting to hear on federal unemployment, back to work bonuses and PUA weekly income for unemployed people.

KpljCyzyBsQ,Bloomberg Quicktake: Now,UChirEOpgFCupRAk5etXqPaA,1605676013.0,LIVE: Georgia Election Officials Give Briefing as Trump Attacks Mail-In Voting,"(Nov. 17) The Republican secretary of state in Georgia said he believes that President Donald Trump cost himself votes with his campaign to undermine mail-in voting.

Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said Trump’s frequent and unsubstantiated accusations of mail-in voting fraud likely contributed to 24,500 people who voted in the state’s Republican primary not voting in the Nov. 3 election -- possibly accounting for President-elect Joe Biden’s 14,000-vote advantage in the state.

“In effect, what you’re doing is you are suppressing your own voters,” Raffensperger said in a telephone interview. “I have no control over what campaigns do, and if they do ill-advised actions that suppress their own vote, what can I do?”

Raffensperger also said he believes Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, tried to urge him to throw out absentee ballots. The state official criticized what he called a “campaign of misinformation, disinformation and outright lies about the process in Georgia.”

The Trump campaign has said it’s found widespread voting irregularities but has cited little evidence to substantiate its claims and none has emerged. Trump and his allies have also filed lawsuits in the state. One, alleging that fewer than 60 absentee ballots in Chatham County were improperly counted, has already been dismissed, while another that seeks to stop the state from certifying results is pending.

Raffensperger said that the state, which is conducting a hand recount of 5 million ballots cast in the election, is on track to complete that process by Wednesday night’s deadline and that he doesn’t expect significant changes in the vote totals. The state will also certify the results by Friday if a court doesn’t intervene. Trump can ask for a recount after that with ballots run through scanners, he said.

Graham, a South Carolina Republican, disputed Raffensperger’s accusation that he urged the Georgia secretary of state to toss ballots, first reported in the Washington Post, calling it “ridiculous.

“What I’m trying to find is how do you verify signatures on mail-in ballots in these states that are the center of attention,” Graham said.

But Raffensperger said Graham and Trump aren’t taking into account how the signature-matching system has been strengthened, including the addition of an online portal to allow a photo identification to be used.

The secretary of state’s office has been batting down rumors and half-truths about the election almost daily, including from the Trump campaign, he said.

“It’s just an outright lie what people are saying,” Raffensperger said.

Georgia’s two Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, have called on Raffensperger to resign. Republican Representative Doug Collins, a close ally of the president who’s overseeing the recount for the campaign, has also criticized Raffensperger.

“I guess if you’re a shill for President Trump you can get away with it, no one holds him accountable,” Raffensperger said of Collins.

Raffensperger said the audit now being completed should give voters confidence in the results.

“The reason we’ve done an audit is that we make sure that every legal vote has been counted, and that should give people assurance that we’re making sure that it’s a thorough process so there can be no question afterwards,” he said.

One of the greatest perks of being president is not having to deal with traffic every day. For one thing, you've got drivers who can take you anywhere you need to go, and for another, the Secret Service can block off traffic for you to ensure your security. It's no fun for anyone else on the road, but hey, you're the president, and you have important things to do.

There is a downside, though. Once a president's term is over, they can never drive a car on an open road again. The reason is because of the lifetime Secret Service detail that all ex-presidents get. After all, one of the least safe places you can be is on the road, and that's just under normal circumstances. Add in that ex-presidents are always a target, and things get even hairier. So, to ensure their safety, they're not allowed to hit the road.

As George W. Bush explained to Jay Leno, he's only allowed to drive on his own private property, far from any reckless drivers or people who wish him harm. He must be driven everywhere by Secret Service agents trained in ""evasive and defensive driving maneuvers."" The rule was instituted after John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963. Lyndon B. Johnson was, to date, the last president to drive on public roads.

60 Minutes, the most successful American television broadcast in history, began its 52nd season in September. Offering hard-hitting investigative reports, interviews, feature segments and profiles of people in the news, the broadcast began in 1968 is still a hit in 2020. 60 Minutes makes Nielsen’s weekly Top 10 nearly every week and was the #1 weekly television broadcast three times last season.


The program still averages more than 10 million viewers, more than double the audience of its nearest network news magazine competitor.

oPvMuzyVOig,PBS NewsHour,UC6ZFN9Tx6xh-skXCuRHCDpQ,1580193435.0,WATCH: Pam Bondi argues Biden corruption concerns are legitimate | Trump impeachment trial,"RELATED:
Are Trump allies peddling Russian disinformation about the Bidens?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQX-XSCMMdY

Why talking to Ukrainian officials disproves the Trump narrative on Biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUSU_JDClE
--------
Pam Bondi, the former attorney general of Florida who is a member of the Trump impeachment legal team, outlined on Jan. 27 the concerns she said the president had about potential corruption on the part of the Bidens in Ukraine. Bondi pointed to numerous news reports raising questions about Hunter Biden’s appointment to the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma. The move “looks nepotistic at best, nefarious at worst,” Bondi said, speaking on the Senate floor during the impeachment trial. 

While some ethics experts have said Hunter Biden’s seat on the Burisma board could raise the appearance of a conflict of interest, independent news reports have found no wrongdoing by Hunter Biden or former vice president Joe Biden. 

Democrats argue Trump used the idea of corruption as a cover for efforts to get Ukraine to investigate his political rival. Trump’s defense team is presenting their arguments as part of the Senate impeachment trial. The trial has entered a pivotal week as his defense team resumes its case and senators face a critical vote on whether to hear witnesses or proceed directly to a vote that is widely expected to end in his acquittal. The articles of impeachment charge Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The House of Representatives impeached the president in December on those two counts.

Are Trump allies peddling Russian disinformation about the Bidens?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQX-XSCMMdY

Why talking to Ukrainian officials disproves the Trump narrative on Biden
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXUSU_JDClE
--------
Pam Bondi, the former attorney general of Florida who is a member of the Trump impeachment legal team, outlined on Jan. 27 the concerns she said the president had about potential corruption on the part of the Bidens in Ukraine. Bondi pointed to numerous news reports raising questions about Hunter Biden’s appointment to the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma. The move “looks nepotistic at best, nefarious at worst,” Bondi said, speaking on the Senate floor during the impeachment trial. 

While some ethics experts have said Hunter Biden’s seat on the Burisma board could raise the appearance of a conflict of interest, independent news reports have found no wrongdoing by Hunter Biden or former vice president Joe Biden. 

Democrats argue Trump used the idea of corruption as a cover for efforts to get Ukraine to investigate his political rival. Trump’s defense team is presenting their arguments as part of the Senate impeachment trial. The trial has entered a pivotal week as his defense team resumes its case and senators face a critical vote on whether to hear witnesses or proceed directly to a vote that is widely expected to end in his acquittal. The articles of impeachment charge Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The House of Representatives impeached the president in December on those two counts.

*** CORRECTION *** 
The date listed on the clip from GA SoS Raffensberger's CBS interview was incorrect. It should indicate Nov 17, 2020 rather than Nov 16, 2020. It is a small thing, but facts and details matter.

Trump Admits Biden Won the Election, Yet Still Claims Fraud | The Tonight Show

KpljCyzyBsQ,Bloomberg Quicktake: Now,UChirEOpgFCupRAk5etXqPaA,1605676013.0,LIVE: Georgia Election Officials Give Briefing as Trump Attacks Mail-In Voting,"(Nov. 17) The Republican secretary of state in Georgia said he believes that President Donald Trump cost himself votes with his campaign to undermine mail-in voting.

Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said Trump’s frequent and unsubstantiated accusations of mail-in voting fraud likely contributed to 24,500 people who voted in the state’s Republican primary not voting in the Nov. 3 election -- possibly accounting for President-elect Joe Biden’s 14,000-vote advantage in the state.

“In effect, what you’re doing is you are suppressing your own voters,” Raffensperger said in a telephone interview. “I have no control over what campaigns do, and if they do ill-advised actions that suppress their own vote, what can I do?”

Raffensperger also said he believes Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, tried to urge him to throw out absentee ballots. The state official criticized what he called a “campaign of misinformation, disinformation and outright lies about the process in Georgia.”

The Trump campaign has said it’s found widespread voting irregularities but has cited little evidence to substantiate its claims and none has emerged. Trump and his allies have also filed lawsuits in the state. One, alleging that fewer than 60 absentee ballots in Chatham County were improperly counted, has already been dismissed, while another that seeks to stop the state from certifying results is pending.

Raffensperger said that the state, which is conducting a hand recount of 5 million ballots cast in the election, is on track to complete that process by Wednesday night’s deadline and that he doesn’t expect significant changes in the vote totals. The state will also certify the results by Friday if a court doesn’t intervene. Trump can ask for a recount after that with ballots run through scanners, he said.

Graham, a South Carolina Republican, disputed Raffensperger’s accusation that he urged the Georgia secretary of state to toss ballots, first reported in the Washington Post, calling it “ridiculous.

“What I’m trying to find is how do you verify signatures on mail-in ballots in these states that are the center of attention,” Graham said.

But Raffensperger said Graham and Trump aren’t taking into account how the signature-matching system has been strengthened, including the addition of an online portal to allow a photo identification to be used.

The secretary of state’s office has been batting down rumors and half-truths about the election almost daily, including from the Trump campaign, he said.

“It’s just an outright lie what people are saying,” Raffensperger said.

Georgia’s two Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, have called on Raffensperger to resign. Republican Representative Doug Collins, a close ally of the president who’s overseeing the recount for the campaign, has also criticized Raffensperger.

“I guess if you’re a shill for President Trump you can get away with it, no one holds him accountable,” Raffensperger said of Collins.

Raffensperger said the audit now being completed should give voters confidence in the results.

“The reason we’ve done an audit is that we make sure that every legal vote has been counted, and that should give people assurance that we’re making sure that it’s a thorough process so there can be no question afterwards,” he said.

dqv5E1Jd51E,Bloomberg Quicktake: Now,UChirEOpgFCupRAk5etXqPaA,1604715209.0,LIVE: America Locks Down From Atlantic to Pacific as Covid Rages | 24/7 Breaking News,"(Nov. 17) In a matter of days, America’s long effort to revive its virus-battered economy has been put on pause -- or thrown into reverse -- as new infections soar at the fastest pace since the pandemic’s earliest days.

California on Monday reinstituted bans on many indoor businesses, and its governor warned he may impose a curfew. Michigan has ordered a three-week partial shutdown, while states including Oregon, Washington and New Jersey tightened curbs. Even the governor of Iowa, long resistant to virus rules, issued a limited mask mandate Monday.

The new restrictions follow a rapid surge in cases -- with the country adding a million infections in the first 10 days of November alone -- that has led health officials to issue dire warnings about the prospect of uncontrollable outbreaks as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches. In a call with governors on Monday, Deborah Birx, a key member of the White House’s coronavirus task force, said the increase is showing no signs of a plateau and that nursing homes, in particular, are being hard-hit.

“The whole country is on fire,” said Ellie Murray, assistant professor of epidemiology at the Boston University School of Public Health. “Since people can be infectious before they have symptoms, a lot of people right now are infectious and transmitting to people and don’t know it. We’re trying to get a grip on this large explosion.”

Vice President Mike Pence told governors during a video conference Monday that the government had 20,000 hospital beds available around the country to handle patients, and that states had 13,000 more, according to a summary provided by Washington Governor Jay Inslee’s office. About 149,000 new cases were reported that day, according to the Covid Tracking Project.

The nation’s average new-case count for the past seven days has jumped 37%, according to Johns Hopkins University data, the fastest at any point in the U.S. since late March. Pennsylvania has seen a 14% jump in total cases, while Ohio’s have surged 19%, Washington state’s climbed 11% and Illinois’s are up 18%. Michigan’s cases have increased 20%, the most since April.

And in California, the number of new cases spotted each day surged more than 51% during the first week of November, according to the state -- faster than the 39% increase it endured during its last coronavirus wave in June.

“The rate of increase is simply without precedent in California,” Governor Gavin Newsom said Monday during a briefing. “Every age group, every demographic -- racial, ethnic -- in every part of this state, we are seeing case rates increase.”

The state, home to about 40 million residents, enacted tight restrictions on counties totaling 94% of its population, including shutting indoor dining, gyms, places of worship and theaters.

On the White House task force call with governors, Birx said many states hit by the summer’s coronavirus surge saw case counts level off after 30 days, but that hasn’t happened this time. Seema Verma, administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said infections have sharply increased among nursing-home patients since October, and controlling spread at the facilities is a priority, according to the summary.

Infections aren’t isolated to a few geographic regions, as they were in earlier stages of the pandemic. They are rising simultaneously in urban and rural areas alike, in the Midwest and the South, as well as the east and west coasts.

“This thing is spreading like wildfire all across the country,” Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said during a Monday news conference. He said he would issue new restrictions on Wednesday if infection rates don’t drop, although he didn’t say what they would be. “I don’t want to ever see a refrigeration truck coming into the state because we need it for our lost loved ones,” Beshear said.
