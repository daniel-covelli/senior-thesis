In which John Green teaches you about the Gilded Age and its politics.  What, you may ask, is the Gilded Age? The term comes from a book by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner titled, ""The Gilded Age."" You may see a pattern emerging here. It started in the 1870s and continued on until the turn of the 20th century. The era is called Gilded because of the massive inequality that existed in the United States. Gilded Age politics were marked by a number of phenomenons, most of them having to do with corruption. On the local and state level, political machines wielded enormous power. John gets into details about the most famous political machine, Tammany Hall. Tammany Hall ran New York City for a long, long time, notably under Boss Tweed. Graft, kickbacks, and voter fraud were rampant, but not just at the local level. Ulysses S. Grant ran one of the most scandalous presidential administrations in U.S. history, and John will tell you about two of the best known scandals, the Credit Mobilier scandal and the Whiskey Ring. There were a few attempts at reform during this time, notably the Civil Service Act of 1883 and the Sherman Anti-trust act of 1890. John will also get into the Grange Movement of the western farmers, and the Populist Party that arose from that movement. The Populists, who threw in their lot with William Jennings Bryan, never managed to get it together and win a presidency, and they faded after 1896. Which brings us to the Progressive Era, which we'll get into next week!

Hey teachers and students - Check out CommonLit's free collection of reading passages and curriculum resources to learn more about the events of this episode. The Gilded Age was marked by the success of the richest coupled with inequality and corruption. Repeated factory disasters, such as the triangle shirtwaist factory fire revealed the unsafe working conditions of the urban poor: https://www.commonlit.org/texts/the-triangle-shirtwaist-factory-fire

https://www.hbs.edu/Pages/default.aspx

About the Book: In The Politics Industry, business leader and path-breaking political innovator Katherine Gehl and world-renowned business strategist Michael Porter take a radical new approach. They ingeniously apply the tools of business analysis—and Porter's distinctive Five Forces framework—to show how the political system functions just as every other competitive industry does, and how the duopoly has led to the devastating outcomes we see today.

About Michael Porter: Michael E. Porter, Professor of Business Administration at the Harvard Business School, is the author of Competitive Strategy, the recipient of the 1979 McKinsey Foundation Award for The Best Harvard Business Review Article, and a guest columnist for the Wall Street Journal. Professor Porter developed the much praised MBA course on Industry and Competitive Analysis, lectures widely on competitive strategy, and is a strategic consultant to numerous companies in the United States and abroad.

About Kathrine Gehl: Katherine M. Gehl is a business leader, author and speaker. Katherine was president and CEO of Gehl Foods, a $250 Million high-tech food manufacturing company in Wisconsin where she led a transformational growth strategy, receiving multiple awards, before selling the company in 2015--in part to dedicate more time to political reform. Her career includes roles in the private and public sectors including at Oracle Corporation, Bernstein Investment Research and Management, Mayor Richard M. Daley's Office at the City of Chicago, and Chicago Public Schools. In 2011, Katherine was confirmed by the U.S. Senate to serve on the Board of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Today, Katherine describes herself as a political innovation activist.

Katherine graduated from the University of Notre Dame and holds an MA from Catholic University and an MBA from Kellogg.

👇 Free Class - Sign up here 👇
https://cf.bookkeepinglife.com/free-bookkeeping-business-webinar

Fear of Failing when starting a bookkeeping business is a natural thought.  But, let's look into it a bit and see if it's justified.

First, we need to realize that it's normal and a part of our survival mechanism to fear the unknown and not like to give up total control.

Second, we need to realize that in the realm of starting your own bookkeeping business, there is no failing, just different levels of success.  You will be successful on a scale, of which you have total control!

Third, whenever doing something new, or something that takes me out of my comfort zone, I try to look at ""worst case scenario"".  The absolute worst case scenario when it comes to starting your own bookkeeping business is that you will learn many things about yourself and what it takes to start your own home based business.  These are great things!  And they're worst case!

Lastly, always remember, in everything you do, your success is measured by your determination.  I give you every tool, guidance, and support to put you over the top.  You just bring the determination!

Prosperity—yes or no? Robert Henderson says when your heart is right, God is ready to provide. Responsibilities come with it. But first, hands off, satan!

Wisdom and Prosperity Go Hand in Hand

Robert Henderson asks, is your house in order? Because God’s wealth and wisdom go hand in hand.

Robert shares three new and powerful resources that bring clarity to provision and prosperity. There’s more to true wealth than you think. He also helps you remove any blockages in the Courts of Heaven.

Unlocking Wealth from the Courts of Heaven—

Robert’s latest book lays out how to:

• Remove legal rights the enemy is using 
• Understand the economic system of Heaven
• Revoke the spirit of poverty
• Break free from “disrupted timing”

Prospering in the Midst of Change—

God is a ready partner. In the same way God transforms your character, there is also a process for prosperity. In this 2-CD/audio series Robert shows you biblical steps for walking in God’s provision even during crisis.

Resetting Economies in the Courts of Heaven—

In this small but powerful companion, Robert Henderson gives you 5 steps for resetting economies. They work for nations, but they especially apply to you! If there truly is a season for biblical wealth transfer, it is meant for believers who know what to do with it!

In a hilarious power move the president didn’t take any chances of the interview being taken out of context so he released it three days before it was set to air.

He accused CBS journalist Lesley Stahl of orchestrating a “fake and biased” interview.

The two go back and forth throughout it, with Stahl insisting she “didn’t want this kind of interview”.

Just as the world has never experienced a United States President quite like Donald Trump, it’s not seen a First Lady like Melania Trump either. Despite being one of the most photographed women on the planet, she remains virtually unknown. But wealthy New York socialite Stephanie Winston Wolkoff is now controversially trying to change all that. She says she was “besties”” with Melania for 15 years, and because of their friendship was not only appointed a senior adviser to the First Lady, she was also asked to organise Trump’s presidential inauguration. But two years ago the friendship between the two women soured. Stephanie claims she was the victim of an orchestrated political hit and was bitterly disappointed when Melania abandoned her. Many are calling it a despicable act of revenge, but Stephanie has now written a tell-all book about the First Lady and her secrets, and as she explains to Liam Bartlett in an exclusive interview, there are plenty of secrets to tell about Melania and the Donald.

The lockdown in France meant that until very recently, lumberyards were closed for business. Unfortunately we were in need of a new bathroom door to complete the restoration of one of the bedrooms. We cracked on with some old oak that we removed from a roof we replaced recently.

In a hilarious power move the president didn’t take any chances of the interview being taken out of context so he released it three days before it was set to air.

He accused CBS journalist Lesley Stahl of orchestrating a “fake and biased” interview.

The two go back and forth throughout it, with Stahl insisting she “didn’t want this kind of interview”.

“Of course you did” said the president.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eUq-GnIZzYk/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-23 17:37:57.690288,right,1.3333333333333333,"['PartisanRight', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanRight']",Right,False,2,H4VZLtKtqus

▶▶Pillars for Unlocking Wealth by Robert Henderson [Digital]: https://bit.ly/3jcLqm6

Prosperity—yes or no? Robert Henderson says when your heart is right, God is ready to provide. Responsibilities come with it. But first, hands off, satan!

Wisdom and Prosperity Go Hand in Hand

Robert Henderson asks, is your house in order? Because God’s wealth and wisdom go hand in hand.

Robert shares three new and powerful resources that bring clarity to provision and prosperity. There’s more to true wealth than you think. He also helps you remove any blockages in the Courts of Heaven.

Unlocking Wealth from the Courts of Heaven—

Robert’s latest book lays out how to:

• Remove legal rights the enemy is using 
• Understand the economic system of Heaven
• Revoke the spirit of poverty
• Break free from “disrupted timing”

Prospering in the Midst of Change—

God is a ready partner. In the same way God transforms your character, there is also a process for prosperity. In this 2-CD/audio series Robert shows you biblical steps for walking in God’s provision even during crisis.

Resetting Economies in the Courts of Heaven—

In this small but powerful companion, Robert Henderson gives you 5 steps for resetting economies. They work for nations, but they especially apply to you! If there truly is a season for biblical wealth transfer, it is meant for believers who know what to do with it!

But if you got a bit lost in the final act of the film, we wouldn’t blame you. So let’s do our best to walk through the bizarre, mind-bending ending of Interstellar.

Life on Earth isn't great in Interstellar. Massive dust storms are tearing up the planet, crops are failing, and soon, humanity will cease to exist. Looking for answers, NASA turns to the skies, hoping for some kind of insight. 

As we learn at the beginning of the film, a group of 12 scientists traveled through a mysterious wormhole that appeared near Saturn, to see if the 12 planets on the other side could sustain human life. A few years later, the Endurance and its crew  including Matthew McConaughey's Cooper and Anne Hathaway's Brand are going to visit the three most promising planets in the hopes of colonizing one. When they arrive on Dr. Mann's planet, the heroic scientist assures them his icy cold spot is the perfect place for humans to live.

Unfortunately, it's soon all revealed to be a ruse. Although each of the original 12 scientists knew their trip was one-way, Mann admits he never fully considered the possibility that his planet would be uninhabitable, and that he might die alone. Although he resisted the urge for years, he eventually falsified his survey data to coax another team to travel to his planet, intending to use the Endurance to escape. 

At this point, Mann is so desperate to leave that he'll do anything, even kill. Paranoid that the Endurance crew won't go along with his plan once they learn what he's done, Mann attempts to kill Cooper so he can make his getaway.

Back on Earth, Cooper's now-grown children find themselves at odds. His daughter, Murph, played by Jessica Chastain, has realized the surface of our planet has become uninhabitable. So naturally, she's trying to persuade her brother, Tom, to bring his family to the secret NASA facility where she's been working on the gravitational equation that would allow humanity to escape into space en masse. 

But despite Murph's warnings, Tom refuses to abandon the farmhouse where they grew up. After Cooper left them in their grandfather's care when they were children, never to be heard from again, Tom lost all faith in NASA's ability to help them.  Keep watching the video to see the ending of Interstellar finally explained!

BA7n-Hl3vBM,WAR - HISTORY - DOCUMENTARIES,UCUo2B-Lt7mgGoF2tfnsMWsQ,1513223922.0,P-51 Mustang fighter Documentary / WHD,"P 51 Mustang plane Documentary from History Channel.

Aircraft of WII together in a great aviation package and a must for anyone interested in these two aircraft which opposed each other explosively in the war-torn skies over Europe. Image quality may vary at times depending on source material used, but a definite aviation must have - and what rare footage!
 American long-range, single-seat fighter and fighter-bomber used during World War II and the Korean War, among other conflicts. The Mustang was designed in April 1940 by a design team headed by James Kindelberger[6] of North American Aviation (NAA) in response to a requirement of the British Purchasing Commission. The Purchasing Commission approached North American Aviation to build Curtiss P-40 fighters under license for the Royal Air Force (RAF). Rather than build an old design from another company, North American Aviation proposed the design and production of a more modern fighter. The prototype NA-73X airframe was rolled out on 9 September 1940, 102 days after the contract was signed, and first flew on 26 October.[7][8]

The Mustang was designed to use the Allison V-1710 engine, which had limited high-altitude performance in its earlier variants. The aircraft was first flown operationally by the Royal Air Force (RAF) as a tactical-reconnaissance aircraft and fighter-bomber (Mustang Mk I). Replacing the Allison with a Rolls-Royce Merlin resulted in the P-51B/C (Mustang Mk III) model and transformed the aircraft's performance at altitudes above 15,000 ft (4,600 m) (without sacrificing range),[9] allowing it to compete with the Luftwaffe's fighters.[10] The definitive version, the P-51D, was powered by the Packard V-1650-7, a license-built version of the two-speed two-stage-supercharged Merlin 66, and was armed with six .50 caliber (12.7 mm) AN/M2 Browning machine guns.[11]

From late 1943, P-51Bs and P-51Cs (supplemented by P-51Ds from mid-1944) were used by the USAAF's Eighth Air Force to escort bombers in raids over Germany, while the RAF's Second Tactical Air Force and the USAAF's Ninth Air Force used the Merlin-powered Mustangs as fighter-bombers, roles in which the Mustang helped ensure Allied air superiority in 1944.[12] The P-51 was also used by Allied air forces in the North African, Mediterranean, Italian and Pacific theaters. During World War II, Mustang pilots claimed to have destroyed 4,950 enemy aircraft.[nb 1]

At the start of the Korean War, the Mustang, by then redesignated F-51, was the main fighter of the United Nations until jet fighters, including North American's F-86, took over this role; the Mustang then became a specialized fighter-bomber. Despite the advent of jet fighters, the Mustang remained in service with some air forces until the early 1980s. After the Korean War, Mustangs became popular civilian warbirds and air racing aircraft.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BA7n-Hl3vBM/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-23 17:38:09.483725,right,0.0,['None'],Neutral,True,2,IwqTN5fhMR8

The FW-190 and P-51 Mustang are regarded by many as in the very top tier of fighter aircraft used in WW2, both had started off with more lowly expectations but through good design and upgrades by the end of the war, they were at the top of their respective airforces but was there a clear winner, in this video we try to find out.

In April, the first dogfights took place. As the fighting grew into a major conflict, the air activity increased accordingly. At first the results were not encouraging for the U. S. Air Force. The most common problem found could be summed up in the words insufficient training and experience in air-to-air combat. But in 1972, when the ""Top Gun"" program improved the skills in aerial combat of USN Phantom pilots, and the F-4E appeared with a 20 mm built-in Vulcan cannon, could the US neutralize edge of the NVAF MiG-17, MiG-19 and MiG-21.

During the course of the Southeast Asian war, the United States developed many new types of air tactics that had never previously been needed. New missions were devised, often under bizarre code-names. Some of these missions have gone on to become legends, while others have simply faded. What does remain are the men who flew the missions, the planes that were involved, and incredible stories of determination, triumph and tragedy. Wings Over Vietnam compares rare combat footage with first-hand accounts, to create a captivating portrait of these unique missions. Over ten years in the making, Wings over Vietnam is the most detailed and comprehensive account of the Vietnam air war ever produced. Featuring rare combat film, Wings Over Vietnam offers a thorough review of the evolving aerial strategies and tactics used by America during the war. It also brings individual combat missions and dogfights vividly to life with first hand accounts of veterans - including John McCain - and graphic air-to-air and through the gun sight footage. Wings Over Vietnam takes you out hunting enemy SAM missiles on 'Wild Weasel' missions, and dogfighting in F-4 Phantoms against MiG-17s and 21 s over North Vietnam. It puts you in the pilot's seat for raids by F-105 Thunderchiefs and A4 Skyhawks as part of Operation Rolling Thunder flying through the most formidable anti-aircraft defences on earth, - and takes you out on night missions with the F-111's and giant B-52s of Operation Linebacker 2. This critically acclaimed Discovery series also demonstrates the awesome firepower of the AC-47 ""Spookies"" and AC-130 ""Spectres"" and pays tribute to the men flying the most dangerous air missions of the war – the crews of the Sikorsky ""Green Giant"" helicopters and the Bell Huey Meac chopper crews.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9WkjdZHkOIY/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-23 17:38:09.855000,right,0.0,['None'],Neutral,False,3,BA7n-Hl3vBM

raEtQ3l0dFU,WAR - HISTORY - DOCUMENTARIES,UCUo2B-Lt7mgGoF2tfnsMWsQ,1516230116.0,The Destroyer - Fletcher class ship / WW2 Documentary US navy / WHD,"The Fletcher class was a class of destroyers built by the United States during World War II. The class was designed in 1939, as a result of dissatisfaction with the earlier destroyer leader types of the Porter and Somers classes. Some went on to serve during the Korean War and into the Vietnam War.[3]

The United States Navy commissioned 175 Fletcher-class destroyers between 1942 and 1944, more than any other destroyer class, and the design was generally regarded as highly successful. Fletchers had a design speed of 38 knots and an armament of five 5"" guns in single mounts with 10 21"" torpedoes in two quintuple centerline mounts.[4] The Allen M. Sumner and Gearing classes were Fletcher derivatives.

The long-range Fletcher-class ships performed every task asked of a destroyer, from anti-submarine warfare and anti-aircraft warfare to surface action.[5] They could cover the vast distances required by fleet actions in the Pacific and served almost exclusively in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II, during which they accounted for 29 Imperial Japanese Navy submarines sunk.[6][failed verification] In a massive effort, the Fletchers were built by shipyards across the United States and, after World War II ended, 11 were sold to countries that they had been built to fight against: Italy, Germany, and Japan, as well as other countries, where they had even longer, distinguished careers. Three have been preserved as museum ships in the U.S. and one in Greece.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/raEtQ3l0dFU/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-23 17:38:09.855235,right,0.0,['None'],Neutral,False,3,BA7n-Hl3vBM

On May 20th, 1941, Hitler launched history’s first ever airborne invasion, when German paratroopers landed on the island of Crete. 

During the next ten days, the 22,000 ‘Fallschirmjäger’ systematically and at a great loss of life, drove over twice that number in allied troops from the island. This film chronicles in a fascinating day-by-day account, that momentous campaign.

8Yxf0JVgGKU,WAR - HISTORY - DOCUMENTARIES,UCUo2B-Lt7mgGoF2tfnsMWsQ,1516229929.0,B-52 Stratofortress - US strategic bomber / Documentary US Air Force / WHD,"The Boeing B-52 Stratofortress is an American long-range, subsonic, jet-powered strategic bomber. The B-52 was designed and built by Boeing, which has continued to provide support and upgrades. It has been operated by the United States Air Force (USAF) since the 1950s. The bomber is capable of carrying up to 70,000 pounds (32,000 kg) of weapons,[5] and has a typical combat range of more than 8,800 miles (14,080 km) without aerial refueling.[6]

Beginning with the successful contract bid in June 1946, the B-52 design evolved from a straight wing aircraft powered by six turboprop engines to the final prototype YB-52 with eight turbojet engines and swept wings. The B-52 took its maiden flight in April 1952. Built to carry nuclear weapons for Cold War-era deterrence missions, the B-52 Stratofortress replaced the Convair B-36. A veteran of several wars, the B-52 has dropped only conventional munitions in combat. The B-52's official name Stratofortress is rarely used; informally, the aircraft has become commonly referred to as the BUFF (Big Ugly Fat Fucker/Fella).[7][8][9][Note 1]

The B-52 has been in active service with the USAF since 1955. As of June 2019, 58 are in active service, 18 in reserves, and approximately 12 more aircraft in long term storage.[11][12] The bombers flew under the Strategic Air Command (SAC) until it was disestablished in 1992 and its aircraft absorbed into the Air Combat Command (ACC); in 2010, all B-52 Stratofortresses were transferred from the ACC to the newly created Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC). Superior performance at high subsonic speeds and relatively low operating costs have kept the B-52 in service despite the advent of later, more advanced aircraft, including the Mach 2+ B-58 Hustler, the canceled Mach 3 B-70 Valkyrie, the variable-geometry B-1 Lancer, and the stealth B-2 Spirit. The B-52 completed sixty years of continuous service with its original operator in 2015. After being upgraded between 2013 and 2015, it is expected to serve into the 2050s.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Yxf0JVgGKU/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-23 17:38:10.205649,right,0.0,['None'],Neutral,False,4,3OkxTWoNf0I
3vB4of_ofGM,Mrbaliandras,UCr7j8840JDddmy9xvTEnddg,1471229762.0,World war 2 Top 10 Fighter Planes (Videos),"World War II featured fighter combat on a larger scale than any other conflict to date. German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel noted the effect of airpower: ""Anyone who has to fight, even with the most modern weapons, against an enemy in complete command of the air, fights like a savage against modern European troops, under the same handicaps and with the same chances of success."" Throughout the war, fighters performed their conventional role in establishing air superiority through combat with other fighters and through bomber interception, and also often performed roles such as tactical air support and reconnaissance.
Fighter design varied widely among combatants. The Japanese and Italians favored lightly armed and armored but highly maneuverable designs such as the Japanese Nakajima Ki-27, Nakajima Ki-43 and Mitsubishi A6M Zero and Italy's Fiat G.50 and Macchi MC.200. In contrast, designers in Great Britain, Germany, the Soviet Union, and the United States believed that the increased speed of fighter aircraft would create g-forces unbearable to pilots who attempted maneuvering dogfights typical of the First World War, and their fighters were instead optimized for speed and firepower. In practice, while light, highly maneuverable aircraft did possess some advantages in fighter-versus-fighter combat, those could usually be overcome by sound tactical doctrine, and the design approach of the Italians and Japanese made their fighters ill-suited as interceptors or attack aircraft.During the invasion of Poland and the Battle of France, Luftwaffe fighters—primarily the Messerschmitt Bf 109—held air superiority, and the Luftwaffe played a major role in German victories in these campaigns. During the Battle of Britain, however, British Hurricanes and Spitfires proved roughly equal to Luftwaffe fighters. Additionally Britain's use of radar and the advantages of fighting above Britain's home territory allowed the RAF to deny Germany air superiority, saving Britain from possible German invasion and dealing the Axis a major defeat early in the Second World War.On the Eastern Front, Soviet fighter forces were overwhelmed during the opening phases of Operation Barbarossa. This was a result of the tactical surprise at the outset of the campaign, the leadership vacuum within the Soviet military left by the Great Purge, and the general inferiority of Soviet designs at the time, such as the obsolescent I-15 biplane and the I-16. More modern Soviet designs, including the MiG-3, LaGG-3 and Yak-1, had not yet arrived in numbers and in any case were still inferior to the Messerschmitt Bf 109. As a result, during the early months of these campaigns, Axis air forces destroyed large numbers of Red Air Force aircraft on the ground and in one-sided dogfights.

In the later stages on the Eastern Front, Soviet training and leadership improved, as did their equipment. Late-war Soviet designs such as the Yakovlev Yak-3 and Lavochkin La-7 had performance comparable to the German Bf-109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190. Also, significant numbers of British, and later U.S., fighter aircraft were supplied to aid the Soviet war effort as part of Lend-Lease, with the Bell P-39 Airacobra proving particularly effective in the lower-altitude combat typical of the Eastern Front. The Soviets were also helped indirectly by the American and British bombing campaigns, which forced the Luftwaffe to shift many of its fighters away from the Eastern Front in defense against these raids. The Soviets increasingly were able to challenge the Luftwaffe, and while the Luftwaffe maintained a qualitative edge over the Red Air Force for much of the war, the increasing numbers and efficacy of the Soviet Air Force were critical to the Red Army's efforts at turning back and eventually annihilating the Wehrmacht.

Meanwhile, air combat on the Western Front had a much different character. Much of this combat was centered around the strategic bombing campaigns of the RAF and the USAAF. Axis fighter aircraft focused on defending against Allied bombers while Allied fighters' main role was as bomber escorts. The RAF raided German cities at night, and both sides developed radar-equipped night fighters for these battles. The Americans, in contrast, flew daylight bombing raids into Germany. Unescorted Consolidated B-24 Liberators and Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers, however, proved unable to fend off German interceptors (primarily Bf-109s and FW-190s). With the later arrival of long range fighters, particularly the North American P-51 Mustang, American fighters were able to escort daylight raids far into Germany and establish control of the skies over Western Europe.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3vB4of_ofGM/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-23 17:38:10.205683,right,0.0,['None'],Neutral,False,4,3OkxTWoNf0I

With its bent wings and long nose, the Corsair was one of the most distinctive planes of WWII. It was the scourge of Japanese pilots, capable of diving at more than 500 miles per hour. But, surprisingly, it assumed its most familiar role - flying from the decks of U.S. carriers - three years after it was unveiled. Drawing on color archival film, detailed computer re-enactments and interviews with Corsair pilots, BATTLE STATIONS tells the story of this legendary aircraft. Relive its early battles, when it was flown by Marines from bases on the Solomon islands and earned the nickname ""whistling death"" from the Japanese. See how British aviators finally mastered the art of deck-landing the powerful fighter, and follow the Corsair through the deadly engagements that led up to the end of the war history of wars",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HHfxP4W3OuA/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-23 17:38:10.205748,right,0.0,['None'],Neutral,False,4,3OkxTWoNf0I

There was little Jeffrey Epstein wouldn’t do to satisfy his lust for young women and girls. It included spending millions of dollars masterminding a worldwide sex-trafficking operation. Countless innocent lives were destroyed. A year ago Epstein was arrested and a month later he died in custody. Investigators though refused to let this scandal go to the grave with him. Instead they shifted their attention to his high-profile friends. One of them is the Queen’s son, Prince Andrew, who continues to dodge requests from the FBI for an interview. But late this week there was a significant breakthrough in the case with the arrest of socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.  She’s accused of being Epstein’s right-hand woman and has been charged with multiple child sex offences. As Tara Brown reports, for the first time in a long time, the victims in this wicked saga are feeling relief rather than terror.

The Democratic candidate told the debate in Nashville, Tennessee: ""Anyone who's responsible for that many deaths should not remain president of the United States of America.

""He says we're, you know, learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it.""

Mr Trump responded by saying: ""We're rounding the corner. It's going away,"" adding that ""we can't close up our nation or we won't have one"".

There was little Jeffrey Epstein wouldn’t do to satisfy his lust for young women and girls. It included spending millions of dollars masterminding a worldwide sex-trafficking operation. Countless innocent lives were destroyed. A year ago Epstein was arrested and a month later he died in custody. Investigators though refused to let this scandal go to the grave with him. Instead they shifted their attention to his high-profile friends. One of them is the Queen’s son, Prince Andrew, who continues to dodge requests from the FBI for an interview. But late this week there was a significant breakthrough in the case with the arrest of socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.  She’s accused of being Epstein’s right-hand woman and has been charged with multiple child sex offences. As Tara Brown reports, for the first time in a long time, the victims in this wicked saga are feeling relief rather than terror.

There was little Jeffrey Epstein wouldn’t do to satisfy his lust for young women and girls. It included spending millions of dollars masterminding a worldwide sex-trafficking operation. Countless innocent lives were destroyed. A year ago Epstein was arrested and a month later he died in custody. Investigators though refused to let this scandal go to the grave with him. Instead they shifted their attention to his high-profile friends. One of them is the Queen’s son, Prince Andrew, who continues to dodge requests from the FBI for an interview. But late this week there was a significant breakthrough in the case with the arrest of socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.  She’s accused of being Epstein’s right-hand woman and has been charged with multiple child sex offences. As Tara Brown reports, for the first time in a long time, the victims in this wicked saga are feeling relief rather than terror.
