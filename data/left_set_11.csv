Ted Cruz, R-Texas, questioned Judge Amy Coney Barrett on Oct. 14, the third day of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing. During his line of questioning, he criticized Democrats’ “assault on the Federalist Society” and its efforts to appoint conservative judges like Barrett to the federal bench. Cruz also said policy disputes over issues such as health care and school choice are best handled by the legislature, rather than the judiciary. “It’s not a judge’s role” to mandate policies favored by either Republicans or Democrats, he argued. Lastly, he expressed concern over the idea of “packing the court” with more justices, a move that is favored by some progressives but has not been endorsed by top Democrats or the party’s presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden. The hearing came about three weeks before Election Day. The third of four days of scheduled testimony gave senators another opportunity to ask Barrett about her record and approach to the law.

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., questioned Judge Amy Coney Barrett on Oct. 14, the third day of the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Supreme Court confirmation hearing. Hawley asked about a plethora of federal cases and rulings and criticized what he described as Democrats’ attempt to equate Barrett with the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, whose judicial philosophy she said she shares. Hawley said he was confident Barrett would make her own decisions when on the court, independent of Scalia’s judicial philosophy and her own personal beliefs and convictions. “There’s nothing wrong with confirming to the Supreme Court of the United States a devout, Catholic, pro-life Christian,” Hawley concluded. The hearing came about three weeks before Election Day. The third of four days of scheduled testimony gave senators another opportunity to ask Barrett about her record and approach to the law.

TrtNExSXDR8,Global News,UChLtXXpo4Ge1ReTEboVvTDg,1605663800.0,US election: Jack Dorsey grilled by Ted Cruz on Twitter's voter fraud disclaimer,"Texas Sen. Ted Cruz grilled Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey during a U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday with Cruz asking Dorsey if Twitter was behaving like a publisher when posting and moderating statements on voter fraud.

When asked if voter fraud existed, Dorsey said ""I don't know for certain."" Cruz followed up asking the Twitter CEO if he was an expert on voter fraud with Dorsey replying, ""no, I'm not.""

Cruz asserted that Twitter is posting warnings on any statements referencing voter fraud which Dorsey defended saying they were ""simply linking to a broader conversation."" Sen. Cruz disagreed with Dorsey, quoting a Twitter statement that read ""voter fraud is exceedingly rare in the United States.""

The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee had harsh questions for Dorsey and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg over decisions made by both social media platforms over content moderation during the 2020 US election.

Since the presidential election on Nov. 3, Twitter and Facebook have flagged multiple posts by users, including President Donald Trump, who have made unsubstantiated claims of widespread election fraud, and president-elect Joe Biden's son Hunter.

Dr. Seheult illustrates the differences and similarities between the AstraZeneca / Oxford vaccine candidate and those from Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech.  

The complete data from each of these SARS CoV 2 vaccine trials have not been released nor peer-reviewed at this time, and none of the COVID 19 vaccines have received FDA authorization to date. 

Dr. Sheult explains some of the potential advantages of the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine candidate including a lower cost and that it only requires regular refrigeration. (This video was recorded on November 24, 2020).

Roger Seheult, MD is the co-founder and lead professor at https://www.medcram.com
He is Board Certified in Internal Medicine, Pulmonary Disease, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine and an Associate Professor at the University of California, Riverside School of Medicine.

Sen. Bernie Sanders held nothing back in his Senate speech demanding COVID-19 relief and stimulus checks during ‘an unprecedented crisis and economic meltdown’ that's affecting tens of millions of Americans.

Sen. Sanders questioned Democrats and Republicans for not cooperating, saying, ‘If we could do it in March, it was the right thing then. Now at a time when the situation in many ways is even worse, we can and must do it today.’

Turner has promised to hold the Biden team accountable and pressure the incoming administration to enact a progressive agenda. ""I'm running in service of the people,"" says Turner. ""We need more, not just bold voices, but people who will take action and will be fearless when it comes to standing up for what is just, for what is right and for what is good."" Turner is a former state senator from Ohio who served as president of Our Revolution, the progressive organization spun out of the 2016 Bernie Sanders campaign, and national co-chair of Bernie Sanders's 2020 presidential campaign. If elected, she will join the growing progressive wing of the Democratic Party in Congress.

""We need more, not just bold voices, but people who will take action and will be fearless when it comes to standing up for what is just, for what is right and for what is good."" Turner is a former state senator from Ohio who served as president of Our Revolution, the progressive organization spun out of the 2016 Bernie Sanders campaign, and national co-chair of Bernie Sanders's 2020 presidential campaign.
