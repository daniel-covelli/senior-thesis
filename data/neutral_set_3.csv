_zhWHsfEa0U,Sky News Australia,UCO0akufu9MOzyz3nvGIXAAw,1603033305.0,EXCLUSIVE: Joe Biden's son emailed shop owner about hard drive to 'get it back': Former Trump chief,"Steve Bannon, former chief strategist to President Donald Trump, has revealed Joe Biden's son emailed a shop owner who had his hard drive in an effort to get it back.

The revelations come as the New York Post this week released an expose detailing links between Joe Biden and his son who was paid at least $50,000 a month to sit on the board of a Ukrainian energy company who allegedly set up a meeting with the then-Vice President.

Information regarding Hunter Biden’s relationship with the Ukranian energy company was sourced from a collection of emails recovered from a laptop that was allegedly dropped off at a repair shop in 2019 and later given to the FBI.

It was a water-damaged MacBook Pro and the person who dropped it off never paid for the service and didn't retrieve it or a hard drive on which its contents were stored - according to the shop owner who said he repeatedly tried to contact the customer.
 
Sky News host Sharri Markson said the owner of the repair shop in Biden's home state of Delaware says when he did not hear back from the FBI, he made a copy of the hard drive and gave it to Donald Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
 

Emails on the laptop revealed that Hunter Biden had planned to introduce his father – the then-Vice President – to an executive at Ukrainian energy company Burisma, a company where Hunter served on the board of directors.

Publicly, Biden has said he's never spoken to his son about his overseas business dealings. These emails seem to indicate otherwise.
 
In one message sent by Vadym Pozharsky in April 2015, he wrote: ""Dear Hunter, thank you for inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent (sic) some time together. It's realty (sic) an honour and pleasure.""

In response to this news, Facebook and Twitter both censored the article from the New York Post, advising they were ""limiting the distribution"" of the story on their platforms until a third-party contractor can ""fact check"" the article.

Mr Bannon told Ms Markson, “Hunter Biden’s lawyer has come to us both with phone calls and with emails saying, ‘hey, I’ve got to get the hard drive back’.”

“This is not some Russian intelligence operation; they admit it’s their hard drive,” Mr Bannon said.

“We have the emails from the Lawyer, if we need to release them, we’ll release them.”",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_zhWHsfEa0U/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-22 13:06:41.503664,1.3333333333333333,"['PartisanRight', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanRight']",Right,False,1,CI_WpkNn454

81WZZMnN7mQ,The List,UCJ7dtuZhjFSJvb_CZjWJkng,1601099560.0,The Truth About Donald And Melania Trump's Only Son,"Love him or hate him, President Donald Trump and his family have capitalized on the reality star-turned-politician's fame. But while most of the Trumps are making headlines, one family member has managed to skirt the spotlight. 14-year-old Barron Trump is the only son of President Trump and the First Lady - and here's what America's First Kid is all about!

Barron Trump is one of five children, from Donald's three marriages. Barron's older brothers, Donald Jr. and Eric, are the children of Donald and his first wife, Ivana. Also from the first marriage is Ivanka, who works as an official assistant to the President, while her husband, Jared Kushner, is a senior adviser. 

Barron's two older brothers often appear in the spotlight due to their leading roles in The Trump Organization. And all three of the older kids made appearances during their father's campaign, speaking at both the 2016 and the 2020 Republican National Conventions. The siblings were also joined by their younger sister, Tiffany, from Donald's second marriage to Marla Maples, who spoke in support of her father, as well.

While Barron may have been absent from the official podium, we're certain he would have been speaking, too, if he were just a little older. And, it's not like he isn't familiar with being on TV… Keep watching to learn The Truth About Donald And Melania Trump's Only Son!

It's one year since I started this journey of building my off grid log cabin, which was a dream of mine since I was a kid and last October 2018 I decided and took the courage to start with this huge build by myself. Since then I came a long way, working in every weather imaginable, seeing many amazing sunsets and overcoming every obstacle in order to have the log cabin as it is now. I documented most of my work and put all of the best moments into this 2 hour documentary. I think I have another year to completely finish the house, but I'm more than happy whit what I've done so far. Hope you enjoy the video and thank you very much for watching and thanks to everyone that has been watching and supporting my channel.

VkuNWDG3yNM,DW News,UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg,1600466054.0,Taiwan: China's next target? | DW Analysis,"Despite China’s increasingly aggressive behaviour both at home and abroad, Beijing’s open threat to take control of Taiwan by force is receiving comparatively little attention – leaving this flourishing liberal democracy uniquely isolated and vulnerable. The threat may be far more imminent than many imagine. According to Taiwan’s Foreign Minister Joseph Wu “the Chinese authoritarian leaders may find Taiwan as a convenient scapegoat. Therefore Taiwan needs to be doubly concerned about a possible Chinese use of force against us.”

CHAPTERS

5:09 What is Taiwan? 
16:05 Why China wants Taiwan 
26:25 Scenario 1: Chipping away 
33:10 Scenario 2: Crimea 2.0 
41:18 Scenario 3: Invasion 
49:05 What now? 

In this video DW's Chief International Editor Richard Walker explores the roots of the threat in depth – aided by military and strategy experts from Taiwan, China, the United States and Germany. He charts the dramatic expansion in Beijing’s navy and advanced missile arsenal that is shifting the balance of power against the U.S. in the Pacific. The video examines three possible scenarios: China gradually chipping away at Taiwan’s stability via military and hybrid means; a sudden, Crimea-style annexation of outlying islands; and a full-scale invasion. This final scenario would pose extremely dangerous for global stability. “Everything that happens in this scenario happens under the shadow of a potential nuclear war,” warns Ian Easton, author of “The China Invasion Threat.”

Adding to Taiwan’s profound vulnerability, there is growing doubt that the any country would come to its aid in the event of Chinese military action – or even have the capability to do so. “Even five years ago, the ability of the United States to come to Taiwan’s defense was greater than it is today,” warns Bonnie Glaser, one of Washington’s top experts on the region. “It has eroded over the last decade. And that is, I think, problematic.” 

In the U.S., Congressman Ted Yoho of the House Foreign Affairs Committee explains his bill that would commit the U.S. to come to Taiwan’s defence, ending the longstanding “strategic ambiguity” that he and some experts see as destabilizing. But could this in itself pose greater dangers? Europe must also take the threat more seriously, argues leading German expert Janka Oertel. “We have not devoted enough energy to these kinds of scenarios. What we lack is a European conversation about what kind of player Europe in the future would like to be in these kinds of scenarios.” m concludes with a passionate plea from Joseph Wu for democracies to end Taiwan’s diplomatic isolation from global bodies like the U.N. and the World Health Organization: “It's not fair to the Taiwanese people.”
What should the democratic world do to minimize the risk of an open conflict between China and Taiwan?

NBC Nightly News Broadcast (Full) - October 21st, 2020 | NBC Nightly News",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hZ1V-BMxJU8/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-22 13:06:54.214206,-0.3333333333333333,"['Mainstream News', 'PartisanLeft', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanLeft', 'Mainstream News', 'Mainstream News']",Neutral,False,1,ZhjtuzlDIOk
SHglo_N7P_Y,Jack Chapple,UCsdJxGA27BSz7IiPMn9VV1g,1600858230.0,"How Canada, Australia, New Zealand, & The UK Are Secretly Forming One Global Superpower: CANZUK","This is the country of Cambodia. It is a small to mid-sized country with a population of just over 15 million people, and is located in the southern portion of the Indochina peninsula in Southeast Asia.

During most of the 20th century, Cambodia was an extremely poor, and relatively weak country in regards to its economy, and military. In fact, in 1998, after 3 consecutives years of economic contraction, the country had a GDP per capita of just $269...making it one of the poorest countries on the planet. 

You see, Cambodia was a poor and somewhat small country, which gave it no sway on the global stage in regards to trade, politics, military and economics.
So that was why, the country decided to try something different. In 1961, the association of southeast asian nations, or simply, ASEAN...was created by Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaysia.

Essentially this was a union created to help accelerate economic growth, social progress, and cultural development in the region, while also helping promote regional peace, and to also give these smaller nations a much larger say on the global stage.

Now it was also formed out of a fear of growing communist regimes in nearby countries such as China, but i will leave that for another video.

In a sense, this new southeast asian union allowed for small and poor countries, to gain political and economic independence from nearby superpowers. And over the next several decades, other southeast asian nations would join such as Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and vietnam.

And all along the way, this new union strengthened the economies of each one of these nations, while also proving to be a somewhat unified political entity, as they showed a unified response to many political threats and wars over the last 60 years. 

So that is why in 1999, Cambodia decided to join this new political union. And since then, Cambodia has seen its economy move from a level of extreme poverty, to that of a developing nation, albeit still a relatively poor and small nation on its own.

However, the ASEAN union has seen its economic influence grow over the past decade. In fact, this union now has between the 5th and 7th largest amount of economic influence in the entire world...depending on what metric you use.

And if that is what a collection of somewhat poor southeast asian nations could do...imagine what would happen if 4 very wealthy nations were to form a new union of their own. A union that would act in a similar way... with unified global plans for their militaries, economies, politics, trade, and even citizenship.

Right now we could be seeing the creation of a global force right before our very eyes.




In the early 1800’s, New Zealand was a largely unpopulated island with the exception of the Maori Natives.
Australia had just a few thousand British settlers...40% of which were prisoners.
And Canada was filled with a few hundred thousand British and French loyalists that simply did not want to live in America after the revolutionary war.

But then, these 3 young nations would begin to go through a massive change. Within the following decades, they slowly began to become more populated, wealthy, and would eventually become part of the commonwealth of countries under the british empire.

Now, these 3 nations at the time were not viewed as the most valuable possessions of the british empire.

India for example, had over 200 million people within its borders, and was one of the largest economies in the world while it was being ruled by the british. This lead to india being named ‘the jewel of the crown’.

There were also some other nations that were in a more valuable geographical location for the british. Egypt, along with parts of China and indonesia, were viewed as more valuable colonies of the british empire at the time due to their proximity to trade routes, and trade partners.



But over the next 100 years, the british empire would begin to fall, as virtually every country that was previously under british rule, would soon declare their own independence, and move away from the enforced british culture.

Except for a few. You see, even after declaring independence from Britain, many of these nations kept their british traditions, and even made their own political association called the commonwealth of nations.

n7hzomuDEIk,DW Documentary,UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,1572911398.0,Luxury: Behind the mirror of high-end fashion | DW Documentary (fashion documentary),"This investigative documentary looks behind the shiny facade of luxury fashion. Shot with a hidden camera, it shows the brutal conditions in Chinese fur farms, and how migrants are exploited in Italian tanneries.

Fine handmade bags from Gucci, Prada and Max Mara in the displays of luxurious fashion boutiques are objects of passionate desire. Luxury labels generate over 70 percent of their turnover with leather products. But hardly anyone knows the reality of their production. The major fashion brands comply with a modern code of conduct that also applies to its direct suppliers. But who controls the subcontractors? The film looks behind the beautiful displays at where the raw material comes from: tanneries in Italy, where migrants produce the leather for luxury handbags under miserable and unsafe working conditions; and behind the scenes in China’s fur industry, where the animals are kept under catastrophic hygienic conditions and before being cruelly slaughtered.

The thought-provoking special explores the rise of ‘cancel culture’ and the impact it is having on people’s lives and livelihoods.

Rowan speaks to academics authors, entertainers and political commentators including Warren Mundine, Jacinta Price, Laurence Fox, Lauren Southern, Peter Ridd and Douglas Murray during his investigation.

Author Douglas Murray says in the fight against cancel culture, mainstream majority views can’t be silenced so people feel they can voice them other than at the ballot box where they give the “wokerati a nasty surprise”.

Cancel culture is not justice it is a “lynch mob” which doesn’t adhere to the standards of innocent until proven guilty, according to political activist Lauren Southern.

mYhDnOHg1m0,The Rubin Report,UCJdKr0Bgd_5saZYqLCa9mng,1598579163.0,Black Voters No Longer Buying Democrat's Systemic Racism Lies | Rob Smith | POLITICS | Rubin Report,"Dave Rubin of The Rubin Report talks to Rob Smith a gay and black conservative (Author, Always a Soldier) about how the Democrats claims of systemic racism is wearing off on black voters, Black Lives Matter’s priorities not representing most regular black people and why African Americans are beginning to see through the Democrats pandering about racism. Rob discusses the differences between the perceptions of racism in America on social media and in the real world. He worries that the exaggerating of racism by liberals is increasing political polarization. Rob discusses the constant infusion of race by the mainstream media into topics that have nothing to do with race like the story of Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the St. Louis couple who defended their home when Black Lives Matter protesters came onto their private property. Rob shares how he went to college to be a journalist and is able to see the way the media twists facts to suit their narrative. Rob talks about how more people are identifying as a gay conservative or a black conservative. He talks about the new conservative’s perception of conflict with religious conservatives like Ben Shapiro on these issues. Rob discusses the controlling nature of what he calls the “LGBTQ Cult” and how they demand complete submission to their ideology and have a lack of tolerance for any view that strays from their dogma. Rob also discusses some of the core beliefs of Black Lives Matter and why those beliefs are in conflict with most black people. Rob shares why he thinks Democrats are starting to be terrified that black voters are no longer falling for their claims of rampant racism. He cites the success of people like Candace Owens, Brandon Tatum as well as the Blexit and walkaway movement as proof that there is demand for another perspective than the one the DNC offers. Rob also shares how coming out as conservative cost him far more friends than his coming out as gay.

Psychologist Jonathan Haidt studies the five moral values that form the basis of our political choices, whether we're left, right, or center. In this eye-opening talk, he pinpoints the moral values that liberals and conservatives tend to honor most. Jonathan Haidt studies how -- and why -- we evolved to be moral. By understanding more about our moral roots, his hope is that we can learn to be civil and open-minded.

mS5WYp5xmvI,Hoover Institution,UCzWwWbbKHg4aodl0S35R6XA,1543286556.0,Thomas Sowell on the Myths of Economic Inequality,"Recorded on November 15, 2018

Thomas Sowell discusses economic inequality, racial inequality, and the myths that have continued to falsely describe the system of poverty among different racial and economic classes. He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.

Sowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master’s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.

Sowell’s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).

Robinson and Sowell discuss Sowell’s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.

JDy95_eNPzM,Professor Dave Explains,UC0cd_-e49hZpWLH3UIwoWRA,1558538775.0,Response to Globebusters - The Earth Still Isn't Flat,"Last week I posted a video about how we know the Earth is round, from the perspective of modern astronomy. The Flat Earth community did not like it one bit, and the channel ""Globebusters"" decided to talk for three hours on their livestream about how stupid my video is, and how stupid I am. I didn't really appreciate that, so I decided to make a video about their video to illustrate precisely how little they know about science, and to further reinforce how utterly absurd the Flat Earth ""model"" is, as well as some of the finer points about the conspiracy. Enjoy!

lbB7AhwaZy8,Professor Dave Explains,UC0cd_-e49hZpWLH3UIwoWRA,1580033002.0,Professor Dave Destroys Kent Hovind (Young Earth Creationism Debunk),"A channel named Modern Day Debate reached out to me based on my flat earth debunking to see if I would debate someone named Kent Hovind about Young Earth Creationism. Normally I stay out of religion, but I dug into this guy a little, and he is a total scumbag. The epitome of a con man. Nothing but lies and misrepresentations of science out of his mouth for several decades now. He's really no different than the flat earthers, manipulating people to make money. So I decided to take a chunk out of him. He's a slippery little greased pig, refusing to answer direct questions and changing topic whenever he's cornered, so I'll have to deliver the knockout punch on the second round, should such a thing ever occur.

YaPa4esJJx4,Kurtis Baute,UCTRM8LE1g6UXrVZKwgw5oEA,1531830693.0,How I Proved the Earth is Round (with my Bike and Two Sticks),"For what I'm currently up to, follow me on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/kbaute/
Follow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/kurtisbaute

For a behind-the-scenes look at this video, check out my Podcast: http://dominouniverse.libsyn.com/03-bike-a-round-earth

The scientific method is an incredible thing. I use it to test if the Earth is flat or round, and to measure its size, with just my bike and two sticks.

Subscribing to my channel adds a drop of water to a cactus (named Sir Stabbington) in my house, and without that water, he will die. You can even go watch yourself water him in real time: kurtisbaute.com

This experiment would have been impossible without the help from Casey, Ryan, Jessica, and everyone at the Saskatchewan Science Centre. They went above and beyond with this project, and their science centre is fantastic. Check out this place! https://www.sasksciencecentre.com/

Here is the poll i reference at the start: https://today.yougov.com/topics/philosophy/articles-reports/2018/04/02/most-flat-earthers-consider-themselves-religious

Also, I tested if the sun was far away or close to Earth. Its really far: https://youtu.be/39uV_lr5oD0

And I did an even easier experiment to test it again: https://twitter.com/kurtisbaute/status/1036255606414471168

Something I didn't get into in my video but really wanted to, is that my experiment was different than Eratosthenes' in another small but significant way. His was done on the summer solstice, and in Syene instead of using a stick and a shadow, he used a well. At solar noon the light went directly down to the bottom of the well. This is the same as if a stick cast no shadow. Since he knew that this happened every year on that day, he only had to measure one shadow, and he didn't have to line things up like I did. But, I have bikes, planes, and the internet, so I can't complain.

Thanks for watching! #aroundearthbybike #flatearth #science",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YaPa4esJJx4/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-22 13:07:07.314391,0.0,['None'],Neutral,False,4,JDy95_eNPzM
T9q-v4lBGuw,Professor Dave Explains,UC0cd_-e49hZpWLH3UIwoWRA,1587737121.0,Debunking the Electric Universe,"I know that I've become known for my flat earth destructions, but now that I've driven that one so far into the ground that it's coming out the other side of the spherical earth, it's time to tackle some other topics. There exists an obscure fad called the electric universe, which tends to attract exemplars of the Dunning-Kruger effect who think they understand physics better than Einstein. Literally. Although not quite as ridiculous as the flat earth, it's still pretty ridiculous, so let's go through the finer points of precisely why that is the case, shall we?

S7G-ruj22Uo,Professor Dave Explains,UC0cd_-e49hZpWLH3UIwoWRA,1539838683.0,Astrology: Fact or Fiction?,"A significant percentage of the population believes in astrology. This is the notion that the positions of the stars and planets in the sky at the moment of your birth have an influence on your characteristics, and that their positions over time influence daily events. Can this be possible? By what mechanism does this influence propagate? If it's true, why haven't we encountered anything like this in our study of astronomy? Shouldn't we be able to do experiments to test its validity? We sure can. Let's take a real good look at what astrology proposes, and see if we can to the bottom of whether there is any truth to it or not.

SixyZ7DkSjA,Professor Dave Explains,UC0cd_-e49hZpWLH3UIwoWRA,1598606980.0,Elucidating the Agenda of James Tour: A Defense of Abiogenesis,"The origin of life! How did we get here? How did the first living organism come about? Can it have happened spontaneously? Isn't life way too complex for that to happen? It seems ridiculous, right? Well, no. Not if you understand biochemistry, which creationists do not. But every once in a while, a hero emerges from academia to champion the cause of the creationist, and lend some illusory credence to their views. In this case, that hero is James Tour, a synthetic organic chemist who insists that abiogenesis is impossible, and he should know better than anyone, because he's a chemist. I was made aware of Dr. Tour after a couple hundred people linked me to a video of his in an empty argument from authority, insisting that because a chemist confirms their religious bias, they must be right. But is Dr. Tour a bit biased himself? Let's find out precisely what his agenda is, shall we?

tC5RalYWZ5Y,Professor Dave Explains,UC0cd_-e49hZpWLH3UIwoWRA,1539831199.0,The Earth is Definitely Not Flat,"Anti-science mentality is rampant in this day and age, and one of the more peculiar aspects of this trend is the current fad that is the Flat Earth model. There exists a group of people who believe that against everything we have come to learn throughout the scientific revolution, the world is actually flat, and the center of the universe. That's not all, there's a big cover up, with NASA, and all the governments, like some real sci-fi stuff. Let's go through some of the talking points of this model and see if we can deconstruct it, shall we?

Rudy Giuliani started his career as a superstar prosecutor and a crime-fighting mayor. Then he led New York City back from the attacks of September 11th, and it made him a beloved national figure. But today's Giuliani is something different: He's the guy willing to say anything to defend Donald Trump on TV, a central figure in the scandal that got the president impeached, and he's under investigation by the US attorney's office he once led. How did Rudy Giuliani get here?

Today’s Republican Party opposes big government. It’s culturally conservative. Its demographic support is strongest among white voters, and it usually dominates elections in the South. And its 2016 presidential nominee has been heavily criticized for inciting racial tensions.

But things weren’t always this way. 

Over the past 160 or so years, the party has undergone a remarkable transformation from the party of Abraham Lincoln… to the party of Donald Trump.

Become a member of the Vox Video Lab! http://bit.ly/video-lab

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

Tucker Carlson has branded himself as a populist, condemning the “liberal elite” that he argues makes up the American “ruling class.” It’s a good shtick, and it’s helped him stand out from other Fox News hosts. But while Tucker decries the “elite” on his show, he regularly ignores major stories of Republican economic policies that harm the working class, choosing instead to focus on bogus culture war stories.

That isn’t an accident. Carlson’s show is meant to distract Fox News viewers from Republican economics, channeling their frustration and anger at groups that don’t deserve it. That kind of misdirection produces what Marxist theorists call “false consciousness”: when workers are tricked into accepting their own exploitation.

60 Minutes, the most successful American television broadcast in history, began its 52nd season in September. Offering hard-hitting investigative reports, interviews, feature segments and profiles of people in the news, the broadcast began in 1968 is still a hit in 2020. 60 Minutes makes Nielsen’s weekly Top 10 nearly every week and was the #1 weekly television broadcast three times last season.


The program still averages more than 10 million viewers, more than double the audience of its nearest network news magazine competitor. The average audience for a 60 Minutes broadcast is 150% higher than those of the network morning news programs; the audience dwarfs the number of viewers drawn by the most popular cable news programs.  


About a million more people listen to the 60 Minutes radio simulcast in several major cities and on its companion podcast. Tens of thousands each week experience 60 Minutes online. The broadcast’s segments can be watched at 60Minutes.com and on the CBS All Access app. Its webcast, 60MinutesOvertime.com, offers content originally produced for the web, including behind-the-scenes video about the production of 60 Minutes stories and timely archival segments.


60 Minutes has won every major broadcast award. Its 25 Peabody and 150 Emmy awards are the most won by any single news program. It has also won 20 duPont-Columbia University journalism awards. Other distinguished journalism honors won multiple times include the George Polk, RTDNA Edward R. Murrow, Investigative Reporters and Editors, RFK Journalism, Sigma Delta Chi and Gerald Loeb awards.

60 Minutes premiered on CBS September 24, 1968. Bill Owens is the program’s executive producer. The correspondents and contributors of 60 Minutes are Sharyn Alfonsi, Anderson Cooper, John Dickerson, Norah O’Donnell, Scott Pelley, Lesley Stahl, Bill Whitaker and L. Jon Wertheim.",,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ssiLlfGT9gg/hqdefault.jpg,2020-10-22 13:07:29.733875,-0.6666666666666666,"['Mainstream News', 'SocialJustice', 'Mainstream News', 'PartisanLeft', 'Mainstream News', 'Mainstream News']",Left,False,1,j05xm-8_wjc
r2fxJI_cP58,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,1597203964.0,The risky way to speed up a coronavirus vaccine,"A Covid-19 vaccine could take a long time. Some scientists are proposing a controversial plan that could get us one faster. 

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

With thousands of people dying of Covid-19 every day, the sooner a vaccine can be deemed safe and effective, the better. But vaccine development is a lengthy process that isn’t easy to rush, and that’s in part because of the final step in testing any vaccine: the phase III trial. Phase III requires tens of thousands of volunteers, each of whom get either a placebo or an experimental vaccine. The problem is the next part: Vaccine developers have to wait until a statistically significant number of them, going about their lives normally, eventually get naturally infected. This can take years.

To speed that up, some epidemiologists and scientists are calling for something called a human challenge trial, in which a subject who has been given the vaccine is deliberately infected. This isn’t a new concept; human challenge trials have been used to develop vaccines or treatments for lots of diseases, like cholera, typhoid, malaria, influenza, and common cold viruses. But what sets Covid-19 apart from those diseases is that it currently has no effective treatment. Because it’s so new, we also aren’t fully aware of its long-term health effects. Unlike other human challenge trials, a Covid-19 challenge trial would entail a risk of serious illness — and even death.

It’s because of those risks that a Covid-19 challenge trial would be limited to the young and healthy, who would be at the lowest risk of harm. But there are questions beyond the ethics. Would artificially infecting someone in a lab setting provide useful information on how to prevent natural infection? Would a study performed on only young and healthy people produce a vaccine that works for everyone? And with some vaccines already far along in their phase III trials, would a human challenge trial do any good at this point? 

Even though no Covid-19 human challenge trials are currently planned, more than 30,000 people from nearly 150 countries have already said they would volunteer for one if the opportunity presented itself. The question is, should we let them?

Note: The headline on this piece has been updated.

tcsdglJFT0M,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,1583789151.0,How San Francisco erased a neighborhood,"A hotel at the heart of San Francisco’s housing wars

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

With an explosion of tech companies and startups in recent decades, San Francisco has struggled with a massive affordable housing crisis. But the beginnings of that crisis go back much further than Silicon Valley. 

In 1968, a group of predominantly Filipino elders in San Francisco launched a battle to protect their home from eviction. Called the International Hotel, their home ended up in the crossroads of a city prioritizing the “Manhattanization” of its downtown area. Their fight for their neighborhood would evolve into a nearly decade-long protest with thousands of supporters and become a symbol of the campaign for affordable housing for decades to come.

Our government had spent nearly two decades strategizing for a doomsday scenario. So what went wrong?

How is it that America, which wrote the global playbook for pandemic response, accounts for just 4 percent of the world’s population yet more than 20 percent of the world’s coronavirus deaths?

One of the most important functions of journalism is to provide accountability, so in the video above, Johnny Harris dives deep into an exploration of what went wrong and when, and who’s to blame and why.

Coffee is one of the most popular commodities on Earth. It's grown by nearly 125 million farmers, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. But as man-made climate change warms the atmosphere, the notoriously particular coffee plant is struggling. Places like Colombia, which once had the perfect climate to grow Arabica coffee, are changing. Now, experts estimate the amount of land that can sustain coffee will fall 50 percent by 2050. It's not just a crisis for consumers but for the millions who have made a livelihood out of growing coffee.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

Man-made climate change is warming the planet's atmosphere and oceans, and the effects are being felt the most at the poles. In Antarctica, home to the largest chunk of ice on earth, ice shelves and glaciers are beginning to collapse, and one in particular could spell disaster. The Thwaites Glacier, in West Antarctica, has retreated more than 14 kilometers in the last two decades as warm ocean water undermines it. The glacier is situated on a downward slope that falls deep into the center of Antarctica. It's why scientists are racing to find out how close it is to total collapse - and what that would mean for future sea levels.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

In the last half-century, the global production of meat has undergone a seismic shift. While meat was once mostly raised on small farms, today almost all the meat we eat comes from industrialized “factory” farms, known as “concentrated animal feeding operations,” or CAFOs. Animals in CAFOs are often packed closely together, which makes them both efficient and, for many, ethically dubious. But infectious disease experts worry about CAFOs for a different reason: Because they’re also an ideal environment for virus and bacteria mutations that human immune systems have never seen. In other words, they’re a highly likely source for the next pandemic.

The video conferencing session between the two schools was conducted between students of Gyan Mandir Public School (Delhi, India) and Adamjee Model School (Karachi, Pakistan). The session was coordinated by Ms Anju Anand and Ms Devika Mittal from Indian side and Mr Usama Palla and Ms Suraya Islam from Pakistan. We're grateful they let us drop by!

The British tasked Cyril Radcliffe with the job of drawing a line to separate Punjab and Bengal provinces from India into East and West Pakistan. Muslims and Hindus weren’t the only ones being separated from each other. Sikhs and people from other faiths were affected as well. 

A Sikh pilgrimage was divided because of the new border, Punjabi people of all faiths were separated from each other, and a culture was ultimately divided.

This Vox Borders episode looks at how the Radcliffe line changed Punjab and how communities are affected now.

The British royal family is very rich, but not as rich as you might think. And that’s because of a centuries-old model for how they make their income — and taboos about earning a private income outside of their official duties. 

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are breaking free from the rules of how royals make money, which just might be a savvy financial decision.

Welcome to our first-ever week of programming for kids! 

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab

Dirt is alive. It's full of billions of creatures so small you can't even see them under a microscope. For 10,000 years, dirt has helped humans convert the limitless energy of the sun into the plants and animals we eat to keep us alive. Dirt has been good to us. But it turns out, we haven't been very good to the dirt. Roll up your sleeves. It's time to get dirty.

We designed these episodes for kids ages 9-13, but we hope all of our audience enjoys them! You can find all of our kids videos here: https://bit.ly/3hLA3Ro

TNQsmPf24go,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,1572629873.0,How Does the Internet Work? - Glad You Asked S1,"For most of us, the internet is virtual, made of Instagram posts, emails and YouTube videos. And, access to the vital utility isn’t guaranteed across the world. Glad You Asked host Cleo Abram wants to know: What is the internet actually made of? And, how does it work? Answering that question involves discovering how internet cables are laid in the sea, if 5G is really the future, and how balloons in the stratosphere are helping people connect.

Will water become the habitat of the future? Visionary projects for a life with the tides are forging ahead worldwide.

Experts forecast that by 2100, sea levels will be two meters higher than they are today. This could force 40 percent of the world’s population out of their homes, for example, in Mumbai, Tokyo, Guangzhou or Bangladesh. The US won’t be spared either. Miami, New Orleans and New York would also have to be evacuated. Entire city districts would be under water. Climate change would drastically alter our metropolitan areas.

That's why ideas that originated in science fiction have now becoming reality. Floating and underwater buildings could become places of refuge. What sounds like a utopia is soon to become reality. The first pioneers are already living in floating neighborhoods. Could the South Pacific paradise of Tahiti also be saved in this way?

This is still all tantalizing luxury. Visionary hotel operators offer rooms with an underwater view. Or dinner during which fish and marine life are a feature in floating restaurants. Many of these futuristic plans involve water. Will we be farming on the sea? Will the ""SeaOrbiter” floating research station designed by Parisian architect Jacques Rougerie get underway soon? Or will we walk through seaports on floating boulevards?

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO

If you want to stay totally safe from Covid-19, and eliminate the risk of either getting it or transmitting it, you have to stay home. But as the weather gets warmer, public places start to open up, and many places enter their fourth month of life under coronavirus, that’s becoming less and less realistic.

At the same time, we know that coronavirus can be transmitted through the air -- and that raises some pretty big questions. Is it safe to go the beach? What about a park? Is a heavy-breathing runner going to infect you as they pass you? In short: How do you go outside safely?

Read Vox reporter Sigal Samuel’s article about the risks of transmitting Covid-19 outdoors: https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/4/24/21233226/coronavirus-runners-cyclists-airborne-infectious-dose

Join our mailing list: https://mailchi.mp/072240d817d6/asapscience

Trump claimed during the presidential debates that a vaccine would be completed ""within a few weeks"". This is not possible based on vaccine trials, the need for more glass vials and the epidemiological aspects of administering a vaccine. Scientists and experts do not expect a vaccine for months to a year, and that has not changed. In fact, the complex biochemistry of the COVID-19 vaccine means some of the phase 4 trials require booster shots, may not create an immunity that lasts and are no where near being administered country or worldwide within the next potential YEAR!? Now that Trump and Melania have tested positive for COVID-19, I'm sure he is wishing he spoke more accurately about the science of COVID-19.

The death toll starts to rise and everyone is asking the same question: when will the pandemic end? Alex Rosenthal details the three main strategies governments can use to contain and end a pandemic.

Subscribe: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Screenrant

Remember when The Simpsons used to just be a fun animated show that parodied pop culture and not a clairvoyant show where they eerily predicted the future? As you probably know- The Simpsons have made what feels like hundreds of correct predictions about the future- including the building of The Shard in London, the Higgs Boson equation and even the Cats movie bombing at the Box Office. These predictions are scarily accurate and make us ponder if the writers are more than everyday coffee stained humans, or they are somehow mystics who can accurately predict the future. Further evidence of this is some of the crazy calls they have made about 2020. If Professor Umbridge was a year- 2020 would be it. We have had a wild ride in 2020, with us mere mortals completely unable to predict some of the events that have occurred- but the writers at The Simpsons somehow did...

In this video we will take a look at some of the most relevant predictions and jokes they have made that we have experienced this year. From global pandemics, to giant flying insects to viral sensations, we will take a look at some of the worst predictions The Simpsons made for us. D’oh!

What was your scariest prediction? What Simpsons prediction do you not want to come true? Let us know in the comments below and make sure to subscribe to the channel and follow us on social media for more Simpsons content!

What will life on earth be like in 500 years? Will humans still be alive or will be have gone extinct?  
500 years ago, roughly only half of the earth had been thoroughly explored and colonized, and the Americas were home to indigenous civilizations, but were largely unknown to the rest of the world. People lived and died in the same homes, or at best, could aspire to end their lives no more than a few miles from where they were born. Yet today, globalism has connected the planet, and for most of the world, your future is in your own hands. The jet engine and the internet have brought us opportunities that can take us around the Earth, while modern medicine keeps pushing the limits of our mortality. But what might the future hold? Welcome to this episode of The Infographics Show- where we take a look at what life on earth might look like in 50, 100, and 500 years.

o4YO_3-MIvA,The Infographics Show,UCfdNM3NAhaBOXCafH7krzrA,1568869977.0,Can You Survive A Nuclear Winter (And Other Nuclear Stories),"What do you have to do if there is a nuclear winter? In case of a nuclear fallout that leads to a nuclear winter, do you know how to prepare yourself? 

The earth goes through periodic cooling periods known as Ice Ages, with the last Ice Age ending a few tens of thousands of years ago. Today we are resting comfortably in the middle of a mild climate period, which means moderate winters in most places around the world and year-long sunshine in California. But today we're also capable of changing the environment artificially, and are already doing so via uncontrolled release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which are warming the planet. But with thousands of nuclear weapons around the world primed to detonate, that warming trend could very quickly reverse and send us straight into a man-made ice age. Hello and welcome to another episode of The Infographics Show- today we're asking: how can we survive a nuclear winter?

xY5vxLsO_Dc,The Infographics Show,UCfdNM3NAhaBOXCafH7krzrA,1577432132.0,World War 3 Doomsday Airplane: E-6 Mercury,"The date is Christmas Eve, 2019, and deep in the heart of Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado, technicians working at the North American Aerospace Defense Command- otherwise known as NORAD- track the flight of a Russian rocket launch. In accordance with international regulations, the Russian space agency, Roscosmos, formally announced the launch weeks before, and filed a flight path with the UN.

The launch is a curious one, as the launch trajectory doesn't follow the typical equatorial or polar orbital trajectories of most spacecraft. The Russians claim that the rocket contains a probe which will use the highly eccentric orbit to rendezvous with a medium-sized asteroid flying past the earth a few million miles away, itself on a highly eccentric orbit. The math checks out, and thus as NORAD tracks the launch entering space above the US, there is no reason for alarm.

Nonetheless, American space and ground-based imaging assets still track the curious Russian probe. The rocket seems to be smaller than anticipated for the launching of a deep space probe, but the Russians claim that their probe is powered by an ion engine, which doesn't require much fuel. Some inside of the American aerospace and defense sector are suspicious that the launch is actually a new secret Russian military satellite, and thus NORAD is ordered to track its trajectory carefully and detect if any sub-vehicles are released from the main body of the spacecraft as it reaches orbit.
