Lko1E82XE90,ARTE,UCwI-JbGNsojunnHbFAc0M4Q,1603481716.0,"Etats-Unis : Kamala Harris, une ascension californienne | ARTE Reportage","A 56 ans, la sénatrice de Californie est un pur produit de la diversité américaine, elle est jeune, télégénique, pugnace et a passé sa vie à repousser les barrières sociales. Si Joe Biden est élu le 3 novembre, Kamala Harris deviendrait la première femme et la première noire à occuper le poste de vice-présidente des États-Unis. 

C’est elle que le candidat démocrate à la Maison Blanche, Joe Biden, a choisi pour affronter à ses côtés Donald Trump. Dans une Amérique secouée par les pires violences raciales depuis des décennies, le profil de Kamala Harris s’est imposé pour incarner le changement demandé dans la rue. Et certains la voient même devenir la première présidente des Etats-Unis en 2024, car Joe Biden a promis de ne briguer qu’un seul mandat en raison de son âge, 77 ans. Comment Kamala Harris est-elle allée si loin, si vite ? Qu’est-ce que son ascension raconte du système politique américain ? Du racisme aujourd’hui aux Etats-Unis ? Du pouvoir de l’argent ? Des bastions du mouvement pour les droits civiques de Berkeley et Oakland, aux grandes fortunes de San Francisco jusqu’aux nouveaux moguls de la Silicon Valley, ce reportage de Marjolaine Grappe et Gary Grabli raconte l’ascension californienne de Kamala Harris en route vers la Maison Blanche.

mv3xkTCk07Y,C dans l'air,UCvg4_wSz4Cmo4xRPXaKU47A,1597335141.0,"USA : qui est Kamala Harris, la nouvelle colistière de Joe Biden ? - Reportage #cdanslair 12.08.2020","""En route pour la victoire”, a tweeté dans la soirée du 11 août Joe Biden, pour accompagner une photo où il est entouré de Kamala Harris, qu’il vient de choisir comme colistière pour l’élection présidentielle américaine. La sénatrice de Californie devient ainsi la première femme d’origine afro-américaine et également la première femme d’origine indienne à entrer dans un ticket présidentiel aux États-Unis.


Le choix de Joe Biden pour sa future “VP” en cas de victoire était crucial. Confronté à plusieurs polémiques ces derniers mois, notamment une phrase maladroite lors d’une interview accordée à une radio new-yorkaise quelques jours après l’assassinat de George Floyd, le candidat démocrate avait besoin d’un nouveau souffle dans sa campagne et le choix de Kamala Harris apparaît hautement stratégique.


Biden garde toutefois une bonne avance sur Donald Trump dans les sondages. L’actuel président américain est en difficulté dans les enquêtes d’opinion, avec seulement 38% d’Américains se déclarant satisfaits de sa politique. Les États-Unis sont empêtrés dans une crise sanitaire de plus en plus dramatique, avec plus de cinq millions de cas de coronavirus recensé et 164.462 décès, selon le dernier bilan en date.


Critiqué pour sa gestion de la crise sanitaire, le président américain ne peut plus se reposer sur l’argument économique, qu’il a beaucoup utilisé depuis le début de son mandat. Donald Trump met régulièrement en avant les créations d’emplois et la baisse du chômage lors de ses prises de parole. Il insiste beaucoup moins sur le fort ralentissement de l’économie américaine depuis le début de la crise du Covid.


Avec un taux de chômage qui a atteint 10,2% en juillet, contre 3,5% en février, beaucoup d’Américains sont durement frappés par la crise. Et dans certaines régions, la crise du logement s’ajoute à la crise sanitaire. En Californie, le prix des loyers s’est envolé en quelques mois et des milliers de salariés se sont retrouvés dans l’incapacité de se loger.


Donald Trump est donc en mauvaise posture à quelques mois de l’élection américaine et sa première réaction à la nomination de Kamala Harris donne un aperçu du ton qu’il devrait employer au cours de la campagne. “Joe le mou et Kamala l’imposture, faits pour être ensemble, mauvais pour l’Amérique”, a dénoncé le président américain dans une vidéo postée sur Twitter.



Joe Biden a-t-il fait le bon choix en prenant Kamal Harris comme colistière ? L'élection est-elle perdue d’avance pour Donald Trump ? Comment les États-Unis vont-ils pouvoir sortir de la crise ?

Le président turc Recep Tayyip Erdogan a appelé au boycott des produits français et évoqué une campagne de lynchage des musulmans par certains leaders européens. Emmanuel Macron avait promis que la France continuerait de défendre les caricatures dans son discours lors de l'hommage national au professeur Samuel Paty. Paris a rappelé son ambassadeur à Ankara. Que se cache-t-il derrière cette crise ? Jusqu'où ira la dégradation des relations entre la France et la Turquie, et plus largement entre les leaders européens et la Turquie ?

mJJFQoyWygM,C dans l'air,UCvg4_wSz4Cmo4xRPXaKU47A,1604457336.0,Le vote qui fait trembler l’Amérique #cdanslair 02.11.2020,"C’est l’élection que tout le monde regarde. Donald Trump ou Joe Biden ? Des dizaines de millions d'Américains sont appelés, ce mardi 3 novembre, à se rendre aux urnes pour choisir qui du président sortant ou de l'ancien vice-président démocrate passera les quatre prochaines années à la Maison Blanche. Deux lignes et deux styles radicalement opposés s'affrontent lors de cette élection présidentielle hors norme qui devrait marquer durablement le pays. Les premiers bureaux de vote ont ouvert à 6 heures locales sur la côte Est, soit midi en France. C’est donc désormais l’heure du choix pour les Américains, ou plus exactement la fin du choix tant la participation est déjà énorme.

En cette année marquée par la pandémie de Covid-19, presque 100 millions d’Américains ont déjà voté, soit en se déplaçant dans les bureaux de vote déjà ouverts soit par voie postale, ce qui représente environ 40 % du corps électoral. Ce niveau sans précédent de votes anticipés signifie que l’on va sans aucun doute vers une participation record. L’Amérique polarisée, divisée, se mobilise pour cette élection disputée par les deux prétendants jusqu’aux dernières heures d’une campagne sous haute tension.

Car si le président sortant reste à la traîne derrière son rival démocrate dans les sondages au niveau national, la course reste trop serrée dans les États ""bascule"", les seuls à même de faire pencher la balance d’un côté ou de l’autre, pour que le scrutin paraisse joué d’avance. Alors dans la dernière ligne droite, Donald Trump a multiplié les meetings pour tenter de décrocher in fine la majorité de 270 grands électeurs au Collège électoral nécessaire pour l’emporter (sur 538 délégués). Lundi, il a enchaîné les meetings en Caroline du Nord, en Pennsylvanie, dans le Wisconsin et le Michigan, quatre États où il s’était imposé contre Hillary Clinton en 2016 mais où son adversaire démocrate a de bonnes chances de l’emporter cette fois, à en croire les enquêtes d’opinion. Interrogé sur des informations de presse selon lesquelles il se déclarerait vainqueur dès le soir du 3 novembre si les résultats sont serrés, le président a nié tout en disant regretter ouvertement que les votes par correspondance dans certains États puissent compter, même s'ils arrivent après le jour de l'élection. ""Je pense que c'est terrible quand on ne peut pas connaître les résultats le soir même de l'élection"", a-t-il affirmé. Persuadé que ces votes tardifs lui seront défavorables, il entretient depuis des semaines les soupçons de fraude.

De son côté, Joe Biden, lui, s’est concentré sur l’Ohio et la Pennsylvanie d’où il a appelé les électeurs à ""reprendre"" le contrôle de la démocratie. ""Le pouvoir est entre vos mains"" a lancé le candidat démocrate lors de son dernier grand meeting à Pittsburgh.

Mais à mesure que l'issue des urnes se rapproche, la nervosité grandit aux États-Unis. Les partisans de Donald Trump semblent enclins à effectuer des démonstrations de force. Certains le font en occupant un pont dans le New Jersey ; d'autres, comme des supporters du président sortant, en encerclant un bus de campagne démocrate au Texas. Signe de l’extrême tension qui règne dans le pays, dans plusieurs grandes villes à l’instar de New York et Washington, des commerçants ont installé des panneaux de protection devant leurs boutiques par crainte de débordements le soir de l'élection. Quand dans d’autres villes comme Philadelphie,  le procureur a décidé de mobiliser 90 agents supplémentaires afin de prévenir toute menace ou intimidation contre les électeurs.

Alors que va-t-il se passer ? Quels sont les enjeux de ce scrutin ?

President Trump revealed to Jeanine that he was prepared to invoke the insurrection act to deal with any post-election riots and civil unrest to restore law and order.

Candace also encourages African Americans to give up on the victim mentality and the belief that systemic racism is to blame for all your problems. Instead have a victor mentality and realize how lucky you are to be living in America in 2020. She wishes more people knew the true history of slavery and the slave trade. Africans weren’t stolen by whites, but they were in fact sold by other Africans. Before that the Arab slave trade enslaved Africans. Knowing black history and this horrible past can make people appreciate how well we have it now, and also explain why there are so many African migrants trying to immigrate to America and very few black Americans are moving to Africa.

She then tells the strange but true story of how online SJW woke mobs targeted and destroyed the businesses of certain users because of their opinions. Karlyn’s experience with online woke mobs and cancel culture inspired her to seek out other points of view. She decided to attend a Trump rally despite her friends warnings not to. She describes what it was like being a democrat attending a Trump event and how she was treated there. She then documented her experience in an article on Medium as a warning to to Democratic Party. The reactions to her article caused her to lose clients and friends. Despite this she shares why leaving the left has actually improved her life.

ziGZVUw2_sg,The Rubin Report,UCJdKr0Bgd_5saZYqLCa9mng,1595564824.0,Anti-Racism Witch Trials & The Left DESTROYS America! | Ben Shapiro | POLITICS | Rubin Report,"Dave Rubin of The Rubin Report talks to Ben Shapiro (The Daily Wire, Author of How to Destroy America in Three Easy Steps) about systemic racism, the flawed thinking of antiracism, cancel culture, and forgotten American history. Ben can’t help but swear when describing the state of the union. Ben discusses the true danger of progressives changing the definition of racism. He gives his thoughts on the recent criticism of “whiteness”. Ben also talks about how the values of American society that people like Ibram X Kendi demonize, are the same values that enabled so many African Americans to achieve success in America. Ben discusses how even liberals seemed to be worried about the turn that woke politics are taking. Ben discusses the dangerous view shared by many on the left that free speech is not a natural right, but something to be used to acquire power. Ben explains why he feels uncomfortable being on the same side of an issue as Vox’s Matthew Yglesias. Ben gives his thoughts on antiracism, white fragility and points out the flaws in the systemic racism arguments made by liberals. He also tries to understand how liberals like AOC can make the claim that cancel culture doesn’t exist. Ben shares his honest thoughts on COVID 19 and how hard it is to find the truth when we have been told multiple conflicting messages about masks and protests. He also finds it hilarious that people like Bill De Blaiso and Andrew Cuomo have been celebrated by the media despite New York state having the highest death toll in the country. Ben talks about the current state of cancel culture and crazy SJW woke mobs and their ignorance of basic American history. Ben also predicts the reason why leftists of the future will deem Barack Obama statues problematic. Their lack of historical knowledge on a variety of issues like slavery, abolitionists, and natural rights enables them to view America as a place of unending injustice. Instead of understanding the importance of natural rights as the foundation on which Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcom X and gay rights groups made their claims for equality, they have a learned a history of the United States that is one long story of oppression. Ben also discusses the collapse of our liberal institutions like the New York Times, the Harpers letter, Joe Biden, Donald Trump and so much more.

Will Donald Trump defeat Joe Biden? Will the swing states turn red or blue? Will we even have accurate results due to all the early voting? Could the nightmare scenario of the Democrats taking back the Senate but Trump winning the White House actually happen? Dave gives his take on the latest election results as we finally begin to say goodbye to one to most contentious elections in U.S. history.

First Dave shares what it was like to be surrounded by hundreds of Trump supporters for the last time before Election Day. Dave discusses the new campaign ad from the Joe Biden campaign, answering the questions “What is equity?” and ""What is the difference between equality and equity?"" This campaign ad makes clear the aims of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to push the divisive policy of equality of outcome instead of equality of opportunity. Dave discusses what this type of policy really means and why it is so toxic.

Jeanine discusses her exclusive interview with Donald Trump. She discusses the historic Middle East agreements where the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain both signed peace deals with Israel that have been called the ""Abraham Accords"". She also discussed the looting and riots that have occurred in cities like Portland, and Seattle as a result of the BLM protests with him. President Trump revealed to Jeanine that he was prepared to invoke the insurrection act to deal with any post-election riots and civil unrest to restore law and order. Jeanine explains why this election is the most important of her lifetime. She feels that never before have the choices been so stark between a Democratic Party that doesn’t stand up to ideas like “defund the police” and a Republican Party trying to instill law and order. She thinks citizens of hard hit cities like Kenosha, Chicago, and Portland are tired of Democrats who have been too sympathetic to protesters and rioters. She reveals how she has even seen an internal memo from Manhattan District attorney Cy Vance that allowed the dismissal of charges against protesters, but allowed them to report any misbehavior of NYPD to allow for prosecution of those officers. Jeanine also gives her harsh critique of NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio. Jeanine discusses how she got to know Donald Trump on a personal level many years ago. She describes the man that she saw with his children when the cameras weren’t on him and what the mainstream media caricature of Donald Trump gets wrong. She shares little known personal details of him like how he never drinks alcohol (he may be the first sober president in US history!). She also discusses the personal toll and lost friendships from supporting President Trump.

Candace also encourages African Americans to give up on the victim mentality and the belief that systemic racism is to blame for all your problems. Instead have a victor mentality and realize how lucky you are to be living in America in 2020. She wishes more people knew the true history of slavery and the slave trade. Africans weren’t stolen by whites, but they were in fact sold by other Africans. Before that the Arab slave trade enslaved Africans. Knowing black history and this horrible past can make people appreciate how well we have it now, and also explain why there are so many African migrants trying to immigrate to America and very few black Americans are moving to Africa.

Kim explains why there seems to be a double standard for how black women are treated on ”The View” depending on if they are liberal or conservative. She also explains why there are growing numbers of black Trump supporters and black conservatives. Finally, she explains why she is running for office in Baltimore and how 50-plus years of Democratic leadership has failed the black voters of her city.

Claire McCaskill says “the polling was clearly off, badly” because Democrats did much worse than expected. Rich Lowry, editor of the conservative National Review, says that a “silent plurality” of Trump supporters that was missed by the polls and the pundits and that Joe Biden was “too passive.” He also calls Trump’s claim of victory in the election “irresponsible.”

The Associated Press called the race shortly after 10 p.m. 
The contest turned into the most competitive and talked about U.S. Senate race in South Carolina so far this century, as TV airwaves were flooded with campaign commercials, atypical for a state that usually doesn’t see high stakes political drama in the general election. 
In his victory speech, Graham thanked supporters and promised to continue to take state interest to Washington and find common ground. 
""Here's the message I got. People like what I'm doing and I'm gonna keep doing it,"" he said.  
During his speech he spoke about national security, the presidential race, and how much support he had. He also went on to say he received two phone calls since the results, one from President Donald Trump and another from his opponent, Jamie Harrison.

W9d6j2uO6MI,CNBC Television,UCrp_UI8XtuYfpiqluWLD7Lw,1604504846.0,President Donald Trump attempts to claim election victory as several states still count ballots,"President Donald Trump speaks from the White House as millions of legitimate votes continue to be counted for the U.S. presidential election. This comes after he falsely claimed on Twitter that there were efforts to 'steal' the election. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi 

President Donald Trump falsely claimed early Wednesday that he had won the presidential election, even though millions of legitimate votes had yet to be counted and a half-dozen battleground states were still not called.

“A very sad group of people is trying to disenfranchise [people who voted for me] and we won’t stand for this,” Trump told supporters in the White House shortly before 2:30 a.m.

More than an hour earlier, Democrat Joe Biden told supporters he’s confident about winning the presidential election and urged Americans to be patient.

In his East Wing comments, Trump said: “We were getting ready for a big celebration. We were winning everything, and all of a sudden it was just called off.”

“We’ll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court, we want all voting to stop,” Trump continued more than an hour after the final U.S. polls closed in Alaska. “We don’t want them to find any ballots at 4 o’clock in the morning and add them to the list.”

It was unclear what Trump meant by “going to the Supreme Court,” given that the nation’s highest court is rarely the first judicial venue for a case, but rather, it reviews lower court rulings.

The White House referred CNBC to the Trump campaign when asked about Trump’s suggestion that he would involve the Supreme Court in the election. The campaign didn’t immediately respond to the query.

“This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election,” Trump falsely claimed.

“It’s a very sad moment to me, a very sad moment, and we are going to win this,” he said. “As far as I’m concerned, we already have won this, so I want to thank all of our supporters and I want to thank everybody that worked with us.”

Trump’s election night claim of victory was not a spontaneous response to favorable results in key states, however, as he would have people believe. 

Instead, it has been months in the making. As Trump has trailed Biden in polls, he has sought to undermine faith in the multiday process of vote tallying, and to lay the groundwork for insisting that the only valid election results were those tallied on election night.

Ever since the coronavirus pandemic necessitated that millions of Americans vote by mail this year, Trump has also worked to sow doubts in the integrity of mail-in voting, baselessly claiming that votes cast by mail are rife with “fraud.” 

He has shared outlandish conspiracies about mail-in ballots being altered somewhere on the path from the voter to the local election board. 

He has also amplified isolated reports of misplaced or discarded ballots, claiming that these anecdotal events were symptomatic of something much bigger than a few votes. 

In September, Trump seized upon a report of nine ballots found discarded along a highway in Pennsylvania, claiming they were evidence of Democrats trying to “steal” the election from him. 

 “They throw them out if they have the name Trump on it, I guess,” Trump said of the ballots, some of which were blank and some of which were filled out for Trump. 

In reality, voters in Pennsylvania this year are on track to cast more than 5 million votes, making the fate of just nine ballots statistically insignificant. 

But it’s not just Trump alone, making wild claims with no follow through.

In the 2000 US presidential election, the Democratic candidate got half a million more votes than the Republican. The Democrat lost. Sixteen years later the same thing happened again. In the US, if you run for president, it does not actually matter how many people in the country vote for you. What matters instead is an arcane system for selecting America’s head of state called the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is the reason the US has something called “swing states,” and it’s the reason those places get to decide the future of the country. It’s the reason presidential candidates almost never campaign in the country’s biggest cities. And more recently, it’s also the reason that Republican candidates have been able to eke out victories in the presidential election without actually getting the most votes.

The Electoral College makes some Americans’ votes more powerful than others. In fact, that’s part of the reason we have it to begin with; in the country’s early years, the Electoral College helped give the votes of Southern Whites more weight than the votes of Northerners. The idea at its core, that certain votes simply matter more than others, is baked into the American tradition. In the 2020 election, it may decide the winner.

Today’s Republican Party opposes big government. It’s culturally conservative. Its demographic support is strongest among white voters, and it usually dominates elections in the South. And its 2016 presidential nominee has been heavily criticized for inciting racial tensions.

But things weren’t always this way. 

Over the past 160 or so years, the party has undergone a remarkable transformation from the party of Abraham Lincoln… to the party of Donald Trump.

We discuss the backgrounds of Joe Biden and Donald Trump and what led them to the presidential election. Next, we go on to discuss their viewpoints on Gun Control and the ban of assault rifles. After, we talk about federal tax and the viewpoint on the tax rate for the wealthy and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Then we go to the environmental issues and address The Green New Deal and how each candidate would support or not support a program like it. Afterwards we discuss each candidates view on ""The Wall"" or border between the United States and Mexico, and whether each candidate would continue building it. Next we talk about immigration and how each candidate plans to deal with the DACA program and DREAMers. We then go on to discuss the service in the Military by transgender people. Last, we go over the viewpoints by each candidate on abortion. Although Biden and Trump disagree on many issues there are some issues that we discuss that they agree on, such as Universal Childcare and a Medicare For All healthcare system.

We're going to focus on liberals and conservatives and talk about the influencers of both of these viewpoints. Now, it's important to remember that political ideologies don't always perfectly correspond with political parties, and this correspondence becomes less and less likely over time. So, sure we can say that Democrats tend to be liberal and Republicans tend to be conservative, but we're not going to be talking about political parties in this episode. It's also important to note, that there are going to be a lot of generalizations here, as most peoples' ideologies fall on a spectrum, but we're going to try our best *crosses fingers* to summarize the most commonly held viewpoints for each of these positions as they are used pretty frequently in discussions of American politics.

Tom Richey explains the powers of the distinctive characteristics of the two houses of the United States Congress: the Senate and the House of Representatives.  The Senate is the Upper House of Congress where all states are represented equally in a small legislative body with aristocratic traditions.  The House of Representatives, or Lower House, is a larger body with seats apportioned based on population.  In addition to its unique aristocratic traditions of ""senatorial courtesy,"" the Senate has the distinct powers of ratifying treaties and confirming presidential appointments to the federal bench, the cabinet, and of foreign ambassadors.  The House, being closest to the people and elected more often, has the sole authority to initiate revenue (taxation) bills.

So, when most people think about political parties they associate them with the common ideologies of the voters and representatives within that party, but the goal of a party is NOT to influence policies. The role of political parties is much simpler: to win control of the government. So today, we’re going got talk about why we have political parties in the first place and then finish with the five functions they use in reaching that goal. It’s a lot to cover, so next week we’ll talk about what each political party stands for and how that has changed historically.

""He says we're, you know, learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it.""

Mr Trump responded by saying: ""We're rounding the corner. It's going away,"" adding that ""we can't close up our nation or we won't have one"".

Watch more of our election coverage: http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

In the 2000 US presidential election, the Democratic candidate got half a million more votes than the Republican. The Democrat lost. Sixteen years later the same thing happened again. In the US, if you run for president, it does not actually matter how many people in the country vote for you. What matters instead is an arcane system for selecting America’s head of state called the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is the reason the US has something called “swing states,” and it’s the reason those places get to decide the future of the country. It’s the reason presidential candidates almost never campaign in the country’s biggest cities. And more recently, it’s also the reason that Republican candidates have been able to eke out victories in the presidential election without actually getting the most votes.

The Electoral College makes some Americans’ votes more powerful than others. In fact, that’s part of the reason we have it to begin with; in the country’s early years, the Electoral College helped give the votes of Southern Whites more weight than the votes of Northerners. The idea at its core, that certain votes simply matter more than others, is baked into the American tradition. In the 2020 election, it may decide the winner.

ajavsMbCapY,Vox,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA,1604127786.0,"The Electoral College, explained","Why some Americans’ votes count more than others.

Watch more of our election coverage: http://vox.com/ElectionVideos

In the 2000 US presidential election, the Democratic candidate got half a million more votes than the Republican. The Democrat lost. Sixteen years later the same thing happened again. In the US, if you run for president, it does not actually matter how many people in the country vote for you. What matters instead is an arcane system for selecting America’s head of state called the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is the reason the US has something called “swing states,” and it’s the reason those places get to decide the future of the country. It’s the reason presidential candidates almost never campaign in the country’s biggest cities. And more recently, it’s also the reason that Republican candidates have been able to eke out victories in the presidential election without actually getting the most votes.

The Electoral College makes some Americans’ votes more powerful than others. In fact, that’s part of the reason we have it to begin with; in the country’s early years, the Electoral College helped give the votes of Southern Whites more weight than the votes of Northerners. The idea at its core, that certain votes simply matter more than others, is baked into the American tradition. In the 2020 election, it may decide the winner.

Further reading:
The historian Alexander Keyssar’s book “Why Do We Still Have the Electoral College?” takes you through the history and function of the Electoral College: https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674660151

For the bite-sized version of that history, Keyssar also wrote this piece in the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/opinion/electoral-college-racism-white-supremacy.html

The Times also had a great interactive feature on where the 2020 candidates actually spent money: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/17/us/politics/trump-biden-campaign-ad-spending.html

Pew has a breakdown of how democracies around the world elect their head of state, which really shows what an oddball the US is: https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/22/among-democracies-u-s-stands-out-in-how-it-chooses-its-head-of-state/

Results map refreshes every 60 seconds.

Final polls show the race between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden has tightened since mid-October, both nationally and in battleground states.

Biden's lead in USA TODAY's average of averages, which is based on data from RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight, reached double-digits on Oct. 12, but has since fallen back to a 7.5-percentage point lead. That leaves him back roughly in the same position USA TODAY found him in its first poll roundup on Sept. 28, when his polling average lead over Trump was 7.2 points. 

Beyond the presidency, Tuesday's election may result in changes in Congress, where Democrats want to regain control of the Republican-led Senate and Democrats hope to expand their advantage in the House.

If the 2020 US presidential election is close, the race could drag on in the courts and halls of Congress long after ballots are cast, says lawyer and political commentator Van Jones. Explaining why the customary concession speech is one of the most important safeguards for democracy, Jones exposes shocking legal loopholes that could enable a candidate to grab power even if they lose both the popular vote and the electoral college -- and shares what ordinary citizens can do if there's no peaceful transfer of power.

DweCuWFPJ9Q,NowThis News,UCn4sPeUomNGIr26bElVdDYg,1604537255.0,Live 2020 Election Results Tracker | LIVE | NowThis,"LIVE RESULTS—BIDEN WINS MORE VOTES THAN ANY CANDIDATE IN U.S. HISTORY: We’re tracking the latest 2020 results. Overnight, Joe Biden developed narrow leads in key battlegrounds Wisconsin and Michigan, with Trump’s path in both states ‘looking bleak,’ according to a NY Times analysis of the outstanding votes. If Biden were to capture Michigan, ‘he would have the advantage in states that would push his total past the 270-electoral-vote threshold’ to win, the Times noted. Nationally, Biden has now received more votes for president than any other candidate in U.S. election history, with over 69.5 million. He leads Trump by roughly 3 million votes total, with millions more left to be counted. If the current trend holds, Democrats will have won the popular vote in 7 of the last 8 presidential elections (1992, 1996, 2000, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020), despite not holding the White House for 12 of those years.
